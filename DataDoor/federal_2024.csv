The specific research objective was to gain an improved understanding of the role of direct groundwater discharge in delivery of excess nitrogen to the bay, which may have contributed to the development of low-oxygen conditions in waters of the bay and associated fish kills. Data collected in this survey included digital navigation information, continuous resistivity profiling (CRP) data, and point salinity measurements. The CRP method is a survey and data processing approach that is sensitive to differences in electrical properties of surface water and underlying porewater in sediments that have contrasting salinities. During the survey, Greenwich Bay salinity was approximately 27 ppm, so surface water would be expected to have low electrical resistivity (high conductivity), and any areas of active groundwater discharge from less salty aquifer sources would yield relatively higher resistivity values.

Once established, variable leaf water-milfoil forms dense beds that can alter the limnologic characteristics of a waterbody, impacting natural lacustrine communities and their habitats.  Variable leaf water-milfoil infestations also disrupt recreational uses of waterbodies and have negatively affected swimming, boating, fishing, and property values in and around several lakes and ponds in New Hampshire.
In 1965, Moultonborough Bay, Lake Winnipesaukee became the first waterbody in New Hampshire where variable leaf water-milfoil was observed. Variable leaf water-milfoil is native to the Southeastern and Midwestern areas of the United States where more alkaline waters appear to limit the growth of this plant. Outside its native range, however, it adapts well to the relatively acidic, low-alkalinity, and nutrient-poor conditions of oligotrophic lakes and bays similar to Moultonborough Bay.
In 2005, the New Hampshire Department of Environmental Services (NHDES) collaborated with the U.S. Geological Survey to investigate the distribution (presence and density) of variable leaf water-milfoil in Moultonborough Bay. This study utilized geophysical systems and conventional water-quality measurements to identify lake-floor environments that may provide suitable habitat for the establishment and growth of variable leaf water-milfoil. The results of the study are intended to assist resource managers in federal and state agencies by providing methods for detecting variable leaf water-milfoil and for identifying areas susceptible to infestation. Ultimately, this information may lead to early detection, prevention, and more effective mitigation strategies.

The specific research objective was to gain an improved understanding of the role of direct groundwater discharge in delivery of excess nitrogen to the bay, which may have contributed to the development of low-oxygen conditions in waters of the bay and associated fish kills. Data collected in this survey included digital navigation information, continuous resistivity profiling (CRP) data, and point salinity measurements. The CRP method is a survey and data processing approach that is sensitive to differences in electrical properties of surface water and underlying porewater in sediments that have contrasting salinities. During the survey, Greenwich Bay salinity was approximately 27 ppm, so surface water would be expected to have low electrical resistivity (high conductivity), and any areas of active groundwater discharge from less salty aquifer sources would yield relatively higher resistivity values.

Once established, variable leaf water-milfoil forms dense beds that can alter the limnologic characteristics of a waterbody, impacting natural lacustrine communities and their habitats.  Variable leaf water-milfoil infestations also disrupt recreational uses of waterbodies and have negatively affected swimming, boating, fishing, and property values in and around several lakes and ponds in New Hampshire.
In 1965, Moultonborough Bay, Lake Winnipesaukee became the first waterbody in New Hampshire where variable leaf water-milfoil was observed. Variable leaf water-milfoil is native to the Southeastern and Midwestern areas of the United States where more alkaline waters appear to limit the growth of this plant. Outside its native range, however, it adapts well to the relatively acidic, low-alkalinity, and nutrient-poor conditions of oligotrophic lakes and bays similar to Moultonborough Bay.
In 2005, the New Hampshire Department of Environmental Services (NHDES) collaborated with the U.S. Geological Survey to investigate the distribution (presence and density) of variable leaf water-milfoil in Moultonborough Bay. This study utilized geophysical systems and conventional water-quality measurements to identify lake-floor environments that may provide suitable habitat for the establishment and growth of variable leaf water-milfoil. The results of the study are intended to assist resource managers in federal and state agencies by providing methods for detecting variable leaf water-milfoil and for identifying areas susceptible to infestation. Ultimately, this information may lead to early detection, prevention, and more effective mitigation strategies.

Once established, variable leaf water-milfoil forms dense beds that can alter the limnologic characteristics of a waterbody, impacting natural lacustrine communities and their habitats.  Variable leaf water-milfoil infestations also disrupt recreational uses of waterbodies and have negatively affected swimming, boating, fishing, and property values in and around several lakes and ponds in New Hampshire.
In 1965, Moultonborough Bay, Lake Winnipesaukee became the first waterbody in New Hampshire where variable leaf water-milfoil was observed. Variable leaf water-milfoil is native to the Southeastern and Midwestern areas of the United States where more alkaline waters appear to limit the growth of this plant. Outside its native range, however, it adapts well to the relatively acidic, low-alkalinity, and nutrient-poor conditions of oligotrophic lakes and bays similar to Moultonborough Bay.
In 2005, the New Hampshire Department of Environmental Services (NHDES) collaborated with the U.S. Geological Survey to investigate the distribution (presence and density) of variable leaf water-milfoil in Moultonborough Bay. This study utilized geophysical systems and conventional water-quality measurements to identify lake-floor environments that may provide suitable habitat for the establishment and growth of variable leaf water-milfoil. The results of the study are intended to assist resource managers in federal and state agencies by providing methods for detecting variable leaf water-milfoil and for identifying areas susceptible to infestation.

"1-meter swath bathymetric grid collected by the U.S. Geological Survey in Moultonborough Bay, Lake Winnipesaukee, New Hampshire in 2005 (UTM Zone 19N, WGS 84, Esri  Binary Grid, WINNI_BATHY) - Catalog",https://catalog.data.gov//dataset/1-meter-swath-bathymetric-grid-collected-by-the-u-s-geological-survey-in-moultonborough-ba,"In freshwater bodies of New Hampshire, the most problematic aquatic invasive plant species is Myriophyllum heterophyllum or variable leaf water-milfoil. Once established, variable leaf water-milfoil forms dense beds that can alter the limnologic characteristics of a waterbody, impacting natural lacustrine communities and their habitats.  Variable leaf water-milfoil infestations also disrupt recreational uses of waterbodies and have negatively affected swimming, boating, fishing, and property values in and around several lakes and ponds in New Hampshire.
In 1965, Moultonborough Bay, Lake Winnipesaukee became the first waterbody in New Hampshire where variable leaf water-milfoil was observed. Variable leaf water-milfoil is native to the Southeastern and Midwestern areas of the United States where more alkaline waters appear to limit the growth of this plant. Outside its native range, however, it adapts well to the relatively acidic, low-alkalinity, and nutrient-poor conditions of oligotrophic lakes and bays similar to Moultonborough Bay.
In 2005, the New Hampshire Department of Environmental Services (NHDES) collaborated with the U.S. Geological Survey to investigate the distribution (presence and density) of variable leaf water-milfoil in Moultonborough Bay. This study utilized geophysical systems and conventional water-quality measurements to identify lake-floor environments that may provide suitable habitat for the establishment and growth of variable leaf water-milfoil. The results of the study are intended to assist resource managers in federal and state agencies by providing methods for detecting variable leaf water-milfoil and for identifying areas susceptible to infestation. Ultimately, this information may lead to early detection, prevention, and more effective mitigation strategies .

Coastal resource managers here and elsewhere are concerned about nutrients that are entering coastal waters via submarine groundwater discharge, which are contributing to eutrophication and harmful algal blooms. CRP is used to measure electrical resistivity of sediments, a property that is sensitive to differences in salinity of submarine ground water. The 2004 and 2006 surveys used floating resistivity streamers of 100 m and 50 m respectively. The depth penetration of the streamers is approximately 20% of the streamer length which translates to approximately 20-25 m with the 100 m streamer and 12-14 m with the 50 m streamer. These data were processed using AGI's EarthImager 2D software."

The specific research objective was to gain an improved understanding of the role of direct groundwater discharge in delivery of excess nitrogen to the bay, which may have contributed to the development of low-oxygen conditions in waters of the bay and associated fish kills. Data collected in this survey included digital navigation information, continuous resistivity profiling (CRP) data, and point salinity measurements. The CRP method is a survey and data processing approach that is sensitive to differences in electrical properties of surface water and underlying porewater in sediments that have contrasting salinities. During the survey, Greenwich Bay salinity was approximately 27 ppm, so surface water would be expected to have low electrical resistivity (high conductivity), and any areas of active groundwater discharge from less salty aquifer sources would yield relatively higher resistivity values.

Once established, variable leaf water-milfoil forms dense beds that can alter the limnologic characteristics of a waterbody, impacting natural lacustrine communities and their habitats.  Variable leaf water-milfoil infestations also disrupt recreational uses of waterbodies and have negatively affected swimming, boating, fishing, and property values in and around several lakes and ponds in New Hampshire.
In 1965, Moultonborough Bay, Lake Winnipesaukee became the first waterbody in New Hampshire where variable leaf water-milfoil was observed. Variable leaf water-milfoil is native to the Southeastern and Midwestern areas of the United States where more alkaline waters appear to limit the growth of this plant. Outside its native range, however, it adapts well to the relatively acidic, low-alkalinity, and nutrient-poor conditions of oligotrophic lakes and bays similar to Moultonborough Bay.
In 2005, the New Hampshire Department of Environmental Services (NHDES) collaborated with the U.S. Geological Survey to investigate the distribution (presence and density) of variable leaf water-milfoil in Moultonborough Bay. This study utilized geophysical systems and conventional water-quality measurements to identify lake-floor environments that may provide suitable habitat for the establishment and growth of variable leaf water-milfoil. The results of the study are intended to assist resource managers in federal and state agencies by providing methods for detecting variable leaf water-milfoil and for identifying areas susceptible to infestation. Ultimately, this information may lead to early detection, prevention, and more effective mitigation strategies.

Once established, variable leaf water-milfoil forms dense beds that can alter the limnologic characteristics of a waterbody, impacting natural lacustrine communities and their habitats.  Variable leaf water-milfoil infestations also disrupt recreational uses of waterbodies and have negatively affected swimming, boating, fishing, and property values in and around several lakes and ponds in New Hampshire.
In 1965, Moultonborough Bay, Lake Winnipesaukee became the first waterbody in New Hampshire where variable leaf water-milfoil was observed. Variable leaf water-milfoil is native to the Southeastern and Midwestern areas of the United States where more alkaline waters appear to limit the growth of this plant. Outside its native range, however, it adapts well to the relatively acidic, low-alkalinity, and nutrient-poor conditions of oligotrophic lakes and bays similar to Moultonborough Bay.
In 2005, the New Hampshire Department of Environmental Services (NHDES) collaborated with the U.S. Geological Survey to investigate the distribution (presence and density) of variable leaf water-milfoil in Moultonborough Bay. This study utilized geophysical systems and conventional water-quality measurements to identify lake-floor environments that may provide suitable habitat for the establishment and growth of variable leaf water-milfoil. The results of the study are intended to assist resource managers in federal and state agencies by providing methods for detecting variable leaf water-milfoil and for identifying areas susceptible to infestation. Ultimately, this information may lead to early detection, prevention, and more effective mitigation strategies.

Data collected in this survey included digital navigation information, continuous resistivity profiling (CRP) data, and point salinity measurements. The CRP method is a survey and data processing approach that is sensitive to differences in electrical properties of surface water and underlying porewater in sediments that have contrasting salinities. During the survey, Greenwich Bay salinity was approximately 27 ppm, so surface water would be expected to have low electrical resistivity (high conductivity), and any areas of active groundwater discharge from less salty aquifer sources would yield relatively higher resistivity values.

"Raw continuous resistivity profiling data collected in Greenwich Bay, Rhode Island, on May 15, 2009, on U.S. Geological Survey Field Activity 2009-021-FA - Catalog",https://catalog.data.gov//dataset/raw-continuous-resistivity-profiling-data-collected-in-greenwich-bay-rhode-island-on-may-1,"As part of a larger investigation to understand groundwater-surface water interactions in Greenwich Bay, Rhode Island, a geophysical survey was conducted from a small research boat on 14-15 May 2009. The specific research objective was to gain an improved understanding of the role of direct groundwater discharge in delivery of excess nitrogen to the bay, which may have contributed to the development of low-oxygen conditions in waters of the bay and associated fish kills. Data collected in this survey included digital navigation information, continuous resistivity profiling (CRP) data, and point salinity measurements. The CRP method is a survey and data processing approach that is sensitive to differences in electrical properties of surface water and underlying porewater in sediments that have contrasting salinities. During the survey, Greenwich Bay salinity was approximately 27 ppm, so surface water would be expected to have low electrical resistivity (high conductivity), and any areas of active groundwater discharge from less salty aquifer sources would yield relatively higher resistivity values. This survey is identified as field activity 09021 (also referenced as 2009-021-FA) by the U.S. Geological Survey, Woods Hole, Massachusetts, and additional information is available from: "

"1-meter per pixel sidescan-sonar mosaic collected in Moultonborough Bay, Lake Winnipesaukee, New Hampshire by the U.S. Geological Survey in 2005 (GeoTIFF, UTM Zone 19N, WGS 84, WINNI_SONAR.TIF) - Catalog",https://catalog.data.gov//dataset/1-meter-per-pixel-sidescan-sonar-mosaic-collected-in-moultonborough-bay-lake-winnipesaukee,"In freshwater bodies of New Hampshire, the most problematic aquatic invasive plant species is Myriophyllum heterophyllum or variable leaf water-milfoil. Once established, variable leaf water-milfoil forms dense beds that can alter the limnologic characteristics of a waterbody, impacting natural lacustrine communities and their habitats.  Variable leaf water-milfoil infestations also disrupt recreational uses of waterbodies and have negatively affected swimming, boating, fishing, and property values in and around several lakes and ponds in New Hampshire.
In 1965, Moultonborough Bay, Lake Winnipesaukee became the first waterbody in New Hampshire where variable leaf water-milfoil was observed. Variable leaf water-milfoil is native to the Southeastern and Midwestern areas of the United States where more alkaline waters appear to limit the growth of this plant. Outside its native range, however, it adapts well to the relatively acidic, low-alkalinity, and nutrient-poor conditions of oligotrophic lakes and bays similar to Moultonborough Bay.
In 2005, the New Hampshire Department of Environmental Services (NHDES) collaborated with the U.S. Geological Survey to investigate the distribution (presence and density) of variable leaf water-milfoil in Moultonborough Bay. This study utilized geophysical systems and conventional water-quality measurements to identify lake-floor environments that may provide suitable habitat for the establishment and growth of variable leaf water-milfoil. The results of the study are intended to assist resource managers in federal and state agencies by providing methods for detecting variable leaf water-milfoil and for identifying areas susceptible to infestation. Ultimately, this information may lead to early detection, prevention, and more effective mitigation strategies.

Global Multi-Resolution Terrain Elevation Data - National Geospatial Data Asset (NGDA) - Catalog,https://catalog.data.gov//dataset/gmted2010-global-multi-resolution-terrain-elevation-data-released-2010,"The Global Multi-resolution Terrain Elevation Data 2010 (GMTED2010) provides a new level of detail in global topographic data. Previously, the best available global DEM was GTOPO30 with a horizontal grid spacing of 30 arc-seconds. The GMTED2010 product suite contains seven new raster elevation products for each of the 30-, 15-, and 7.5-arc-second spatial resolutions and incorporates the current best available global elevation data. The new elevation products have been produced using the following aggregation methods: minimum elevation, maximum elevation, mean elevation, median elevation, standard deviation of elevation, systematic subsample, and breakline emphasis. Metadata have also been produced to identify the source and attributes of all the input elevation data used to derive the output products. Many of these products will be suitable for various regional continental-scale land cover mapping, extraction of drainage features for hydrologic modeling, and geometric and radiometric correction of medium and coarse resolution satellite image data. The global aggregated vertical accuracy of GMTED2010 can be summarized in terms of the resolution and RMSE of the products with respect to a global set of control points (estimated global accuracy of 6 m RMSE) provided by the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA). At 30 arc-seconds, the GMTED2010 RMSE range is between 25 and 42 meters; at 15 arc-seconds, the RMSE range is between 29 and 32 meters; and at 7.5 arc-seconds, the RMSE range is between 26 and 30 meters. GMTED2010 is a major improvement in consistency and vertical accuracy over GTOPO30, which has a 66 m RMSE globally compared to the same NGA control points. In areas where new sources of higher resolution data were available, the GMTED2010 products are substantially better than the aggregated global statistics; however, large areas still exist, particularly above 60 degrees North latitude, that lack good elevation data. As new data become available, especially in areas that have poor coverage in the current model, it is hoped that new versions of GMTED2010 might be generated and thus gradually improve the global model."

"Rock glaciers, Disko Island, Greenland, Version 1 - Catalog",https://catalog.data.gov//dataset/rock-glaciers-disko-island-greenland-version-1,"Disko Island (8600 km2) is situated west of central  mainland Greenland. The island is part of the Tertiary volcanic province of West Greenland and is mainly made up by lavas. The landscape is a plateau basalt landscape with cirque carved lava plateaus and U-shaped valleys and fjords. Rock glaciers are frequent in Disko Island (Humlum, 1982). In southern Disko Island, about 60 km SSE of the two study sites, meteorological observations have been carried out since 1923 in the village of Godhavn. The present (1961-1990) mean annual air temperature is -3.9 C, the coldest month is March (-15.1 C), and July is the warmest month (7.1 C). The mean annual precipitation at Godhavn is about 400 mm water equivalent. Most of the precipitation (75 %) usually falls during the period June to December, associated with advection of moist, maritime air masses from the south and southwest along the Davis Strait. The remaining part of the year is comparatively dry, as it is dominated by cold and dry katabatic air masses flowing off the Greenland Ice Sheet to the east. Approximately 60-70 % of the mean annual precipitation is snow and in Godhavn a persistent snow cover is registered from late September to late May."

DORIS is a dual-frequency Doppler system consisting of a receiver flying aboard a satellite and a globally distributed network of ground beacons. The DORIS receiver on-board the orbiting satellite tracks the dual-frequency radio signals transmitted by the network of ground beacons and generates the DORIS data. A measurement is made of either the Doppler shift or absolute phase as the satellite’s orbit moves over the ground-based beacon. DORIS data records contain a time-tagged range-rate measurement with associated ancillary information. The data records also contain information about any corrections that may have been applied during the processing phase, such as for the ionosphere, troposphere, and satellite center of mass, among others. Furthermore, meteorological measurements (e.g., temperature, relative humidity, ground pressure) recorded by instruments co-located with the ground-based beacons are included with the DORIS data and can be used to determine the tropospheric correction. DORIS data in RINEX format are supplied to the data center in daily files and are forwarded with a typical 1-day delay. More information about these data is available on the CDDIS website at "

The SIZONet web interface, which transitioned to AAOKH in 2015, provides access to a database of local observations spatially referenced around Alaska coastal communities. The database brings together two distinct knowledge systems of western science and Indigenous Knowledge. As an archive and instruction tool, the interface offers collaborating opportunities for researchers and local observers. Since it is designed to change in response to the evolving nature of the observations, the database provides a framework for researchers to track and compare specific climatic, environmental and ecological features, and events across geographic locations and over time. The goal of this project is to document and share Indigenous Knowledge alongside western scientific data in the context of changing sea ice and environmental conditions. In documenting local environmental changes, including sea ice conditions, records may offer insight into how those changes affect community and cultural activities. Arctic coastal communities have long recognized that sea ice conditions are not what they once were: the ocean is freezing later in the fall and ice is melting earlier in the spring, shore-fast ice is less stable, there is far less thick multiyear ice, and environmental conditions overall are less predictable. To view the observations in the database, visitors must agree to the Use Agreement and enter as a Guest. Members of the participating Alaska communities can log in as a Registered User for a more robust use of the interface.

There are two different algorithms used to derive total precipitable water vapor in this data product: a near-infrared algorithm and an infrared algorithm. The near-infrared algorithm relies on observations of reflected solar radiation in MODIS's near-infrared channels, thus, the near-infrared retrievals are only produced during the daytime over surfaces that reflect near-infrared energy. As a result, the near-infrared algorithm is only applied over clear, cloud free land areas of the globe and above clouds over both the land and ocean. Over clear ocean areas, water-vapor estimates are provided over extended sun glint areas. Data produced by the near-infrared algorithm are generated at a 1-km spatial resolution. "

SLR provides unambiguous range measurements to mm precision that can be aggregated over the global network to provide very accurate satellite orbits, time histories of station position and motion, and many other geophysical parameters. SLR operates in the optical region and is the only space geodetic technique that measures unambiguous range directly. Analysis of SLR data contributes to the terrestrial reference frame, modeling of the spatial and temporal variations of the Earth's gravitational field, and monitoring of millimeter-level variations in the location of the center of mass of the total Earth system (solid Earth-atmosphere-oceans). In addition, SLR provides precise orbit determination for spaceborne radar altimeter missions. It provides a means for sub-nanosecond global time transfer, and a basis for special tests of the Theory of General Relativity. Analysis Centers (ACs) of the International Laser Ranging Service (ILRS) retrieve SLR data on regular schedules to produce precise station positions and velocities for stations in the ILRS network. The ACs also generate Earth Orientation Parameters from the SLR data. These individual AC solutions are used by the ILRS Analysis Center Coordinators (ACC) to generate the official ILRS final combined station position plus ERP products, as well as backup combination. The final products are considered the most consistent and highest quality ILRS solutions; they consist of daily station position/ERP files, generated on a daily basis with a typical delay of 2 days. All station position/ERP solution files utilize the Software Independent Exchange (SINEX) format and span 1 day from 00:00 to 23:45 UTC."

The IGS Analysis Center Coordinator (ACC) uses these individual AC solutions to generate the official IGS ultra-rapid combined orbit products. The ultra-rapid orbit and clock combination is a sub-daily solution, released four times per day, at 03:00, 09:00, 15:00, and 21:00 UTC (prior to GPS week 1267 they were released twice daily). In this way the average age of the predictions is reduced to 6 hours (compared to 36 hours for the old IGS predicted products and 9 hours for the twice-daily ultra-rapid solutions). IGS ultra-rapid orbit files contain 48 hours of tabulated orbital ephemerides, and the start/stop epochs continuously shift by 6 hours with each update. The first 24 hours of each IGS ultra-rapid orbit are based on the most recent GNSS observational data from the IGS hourly tracking network. At the time of release, the observed orbits have an initial latency of 3 hours. The next 24 hours of each file are predicted orbits, extrapolated from the observed orbits. The orbits within each ultra-rapid product file are, however, continuous at the boundary between the observed and predicted parts. Normally, the predicted orbits between 3 and 9 hours into the second half of each ultra-rapid orbit file are most relevant for true real time applications. All orbit solution files utilize the extended standard product-3 (SP3c) format. The reduced latency on availability of these products allows for significantly improved orbit predictions and reduced errors for user applications."

This product is derived from data collected by the Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) on board the Aqua satellite. There are two different algorithms used to derive total precipitable water vapor in this data product: a near-infrared algorithm and an infrared algorithm. The near-infrared algorithm relies on observations of reflected solar radiation in MODIS's near-infrared channels, thus, the near-infrared retrievals are only produced during the daytime over surfaces that reflect near-infrared energy. As a result, the near-infrared algorithm is only applied over clear, cloud free land areas of the globe and above clouds over both the land and ocean. Over clear ocean areas, water-vapor estimates are provided over extended sun glint areas. Data produced by the near-infrared algorithm are generated at a 1-km spatial resolution. "

The AIRS Level 3 Daily Gridded Product contains standard retrieval means, standard deviations and input counts. Each file covers a temporal period of 24 hours for either the descending (equatorial crossing North to South at 1:30 AM local time) or ascending (equatorial crossing South to North at 1:30 PM local time) orbit. The data starts at the international dateline and progresses westward (as do the subsequent orbits of the satellite) so that neighboring gridded cells of data are no more than a swath of time apart (about 90 minutes). The two parts of a scan line crossing the dateline are included in separate L3 files, according to the date, so that data points in a grid box are always coincident in time. The edge of the AIRS Level 3 gridded cells is at the date line (the 180E/W longitude boundary). When plotted, this produces a map with 0 degrees longitude in the center of the image unless the bins are reordered. This method is preferred because the left (West) side of the image and the right (East) side of the image contain data farthest apart in time. The gridding scheme used by AIRS is the same as used by TOVS Pathfinder to create Level 3 products. The daily Level 3 products have gores between satellite paths where there is no coverage for that day. The geophysical parameters have been averaged and binned into 1 x 1 deg grid cells, from -180.0 to +180.0 deg longitude and from -90.0 to +90.0 deg latitude. For each grid map of 4-byte floating-point mean values there is a corresponding 4-byte floating-point map of standard deviation and a 2-byte integer grid map of counts. The counts map provides the user with the number of points per bin that were included in the mean and can be used to generate custom multi-day maps from the daily gridded products. The thermodynamic parameters are: Skin Temperature (land and sea surface), Air Temperature at the surface, Profiles of Air Temperature and Water Vapor, Tropopause Characteristics, Column Precipitable Water, Cloud Amount/Frequency, Cloud Height, Cloud Top Pressure, Cloud Top Temperature, Reflectance, Emissivity, Surface Pressure, Cloud Vertical Distribution.

DORIS is a dual-frequency Doppler system consisting of a receiver flying aboard a satellite and a globally distributed network of ground beacons. The DORIS receiver on-board the orbiting satellite tracks the dual-frequency radio signals transmitted by the network of ground beacons and generates the DORIS data. A measurement is made of either the Doppler shift or absolute phase as the satellite’s orbit moves over the ground-based beacon. DORIS data records contain a time-tagged range-rate measurement with associated ancillary information. DORIS observations from a global network can be utilized for a variety of products. Analysis Centers (ACs) of the International DORIS Service (IDS) retrieve DORIS data on a regular basis to compute weekly station position solutions for the DORIS beacons supporting the IDS network.

"Rock-Ice Feature Inventory for the Sierra Nevada, California, USA, Version 1 - Catalog",https://catalog.data.gov//dataset/rock-ice-feature-inventory-for-the-sierra-nevada-california-usa-version-1,"The Sierra Nevada is a tectonic uplift mountain range with a gradual gain in elevation on the west side and a steep escarpment on the east.  Most of the mapped locations are east of the Sierran crest. The climate in the region is Mediterranean, with most of the precipitation in the winter months coming as snow at high elevations, but with some monsoonal precipitation in the summer, particularly in the southern end of the range.   There is a very steep gradient in decreasing precipitation eastward from the Sierran crest as a result of rain-shadow orographic effects from the predominately eastward-moving Pacific frontal storms.  PRISM-estimated (Daly et al. 1994) annual precipitation for the RIF locations ranged from 580 to 1880 mm; July precipitation from 5 to 33 mm.  Mean annual maximum temperatures ranged from 1.8 to 15.2 oC, January from -5.7 to 6.2 oC, and July from 11 to 26.3 oC.  Mean annual minima ranged from -8.1 to -0.4 oC, January from -15 to -7 oC, and July from 1.2 to 8.9 oC.  The highest temperatures and lowest precipitation were largely at relict Pleistocene rock glaciers, which tended to be farthest east of the Sierran crest and lower in elevation. We mapped over 430 RIFs, based on field surveys and grouped them into six classes based on morphology and location. These categories constitute a greater range of frozen-ground features than are commonly described in rock-glacier surveys.  Although granitic substrates dominate the Sierra Nevada, they do not in the eastern escarpment, so substrates in the RIF database are about equally divided between granitic and metamorphic.  Ages of rock glaciers ranged from current (active) to relict (late Pleistocene).  We interpreted the presence of outlet springs, basal lakes, suspended silt in outlet streams, and fringing phreatophytic vegetation, in addition to morphologic indications of current rock movement, as evidence for interstitial ice, either persistent or seasonal."

The data include recent pedons from analyses for soil characterization and research within the National Cooperative Soil Survey. Less-than-complete characterization data are available for many pedons because only selected measurements were planned or because the planned measurements are not yet complete. This database is dynamic-- data for additional pedons are added as they are sampled and analyzed, other information is updated as pedons are classified, suspect measurements are rerun and replaced, and errors are found and corrected. The data on the NSSC-SSL CD-ROM represent a 'snapshot' of the database. The database includes pedons that represent the central concept of a soil series, pedons that represent the central concept of a map unit but not of a series, and pedons sampled to bracket a range of properties within a series or landscape. Thus, attribute data for some data elements may be incomplete or missing for certain portions of the United States. In instances where data are unavailable, a mask should be used to exclude the area from the analysis. For research purposes, all data are retained in the database. Users unfamiliar with a given soil or set of data may want to consult with a research soil scientist at the National Soil Survey Center. A research soil scientist can be reached by telephone at (402) 437-5006, or by writing the Soil Survey Laboratory Head, National Soil Survey Center, Natural Resources Conservation Service, Federal Building, Room 152, 100 Centennial Mall North, Lincoln, NE 68508-3866 USA.

Fast Longwave And SHortwave Fluxes (FLASHflux) NOAA-20 Clouds and Radiative Swath (SSF) Version1B - Catalog,https://catalog.data.gov//dataset/fast-longwave-and-shortwave-fluxes-flashflux-noaa-20-clouds-and-radiative-swath-ssf-versio,"FLASH_SSF_NOAA20-FM6-VIIRS_Version1B data are near real-time CERES observed TOA fluxes, clouds, and parameterized surface fluxes, not officially calibrated. The Fast Longwave and SHortwave Flux (FLASHFlux) data are a product line of the Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy Systems (CERES) project designed for processing and release of top-of-atmosphere (TOA) and surface radiative fluxes within one week of CERES instrument measurement. The FLASHFlux data product is a rapid-release product based on the algorithms developed for and data collected by the CERES project. CERES is currently producing world-class climate data products derived from measurements taken aboard NASA's Terra and Aqua spacecraft. While of exceptional fidelity, these data products require considerable processing time to assure quality, verify accuracy, and assess precision. The result is that CERES data are typically released up to six months after acquiring the initial measurements. Such delays are of little consequence for climate studies, especially considering the improved quality of the released data products. Thus, FLASHFlux products are not intended to achieve climate quality.FLASHFlux data products were envisioned as a resource whereby CERES data could be provided to the community within a week of the initial measurements, with some calibration accuracy requirements relaxed to gain speed. The Single Scanner Footprint TOA/Surface Fluxes and Clouds (SSF) product contains one hour of instantaneous Fast Longwave And SHortwave Fluxes (FLASHFlux) data for a single Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy Systems (CERES) scanner instrument. The SSF combines instantaneous CERES data with scene information from a higher-resolution imager such as the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) on the NOAA-20 satellite and meteorological and ozone information from The Goddard Earth Observing System (GEOS) GEOS-IT Atmospheric Data Assimilation System (GEOS-5 ADAS). Scene identification and cloud properties are defined at the higher image resolution, and these data are averaged over the larger CERES footprint. For each CERES footprint, the SSF contains Top-of-Atmosphere fluxes in SW, LW, and incoming NET, surface fluxes using the Langley parameterized shortwave and longwave algorithms, and cloud information. CERES is a key component of the Earth Observing System (EOS) program. The CERES instruments provide radiometric measurements of the Earth's atmosphere from three broadband channels. The CERES mission is a follow-up to the successful Earth Radiation Budget Experiment (ERBE) mission. The first CERES instrument (PFM) was launched on November 27, 1997, as part of the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM). Two CERES instruments (FM1 and FM2) were launched into polar orbit on board the EOS flagship Terra on December 18, 1999. Two additional CERES instruments (FM3 and FM4) were launched on board EOS Aqua on May 4, 2002. CERES instrument Flight Model 5 (FM5) was launched on board the Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (NPP) satellite on October 28, 2011. The latest CERES instrument (FM6) was launched on board NOAA-20 on November 18, 2017."

SLR provides unambiguous range measurements to mm precision that can be aggregated over the global network to provide very accurate satellite orbits, time histories of station position and motion, and many other geophysical parameters. SLR operates in the optical region and is the only space geodetic technique that measures unambiguous range directly. Analysis of SLR data contributes to the terrestrial reference frame, modeling of the spatial and temporal variations of the Earth's gravitational field, and monitoring of millimeter-level variations in the location of the center of mass of the total Earth system (solid Earth-atmosphere-oceans). In addition, SLR provides precise orbit determination for spaceborne radar altimeter missions. It provides a means for sub-nanosecond global time transfer, and a basis for special tests of the Theory of General Relativity. Analysis Centers (ACs) of the International Laser Ranging Service (ILRS) retrieve SLR data on regular schedules to produce precise station positions and velocities for stations in the ILRS network. The ACs also generate Earth Orientation Parameters from the SLR data. The ILRS Analysis Center Coordinators (ACC) uses these individual AC solutions to generate the official ILRS final combined station position plus ERP products, as well as backup combination. The final products are considered the most consistent and highest quality ILRS solutions; they consist of daily station position/ERP files, generated on a daily basis with a typical delay of 2 days.

It provides a means for sub-nanosecond global time transfer, and a basis for special tests of the Theory of General Relativity. Analysis Centers (ACs) of the International Laser Ranging Service (ILRS) retrieve SLR data on regular schedules to produce precise station positions and velocities for stations in the ILRS network. The daily SLR normal point observation files contain data received in the previous 24-hour period from a global network of stations ranging to satellites equipped with retroreflectors. Data are available in ILRS data format (older data sets) and/or the Consolidated Ranging Data (CRD) format. More information about these data is available on the CDDIS website at "

The AIRS Only Level 3 Daily Gridded Product contains standard retrieval means, standard deviations and input counts. Each file covers a temporal period of 24 hours for either the descending (equatorial crossing North to South @1:30 AM local time) or ascending (equatorial crossing South to North @1:30 PM local time) orbit. The data starts at the international dateline and progresses westward (as do the subsequent orbits of the satellite) so that neighboring gridded cells of data are no more than a swath of time apart (about 90 minutes). The two parts of a scan line crossing the dateline are included in separate L3 files, according to the date, so that data points in a grid box are always coincident in time. The edge of the AIRS Level 3 gridded cells is at the date line (the 180E/W longitude boundary). When plotted, this produces a map with 0 degrees longitude in the center of the image unless the bins are reordered. This method is preferred because the left (West) side of the image and the right (East) side of the image contain data farthest apart in time. The gridding scheme used by AIRS is the same as used by TOVS Pathfinder to create Level 3 products. The daily Level 3 products have gores between satellite paths where there is no coverage for that day. The geophysical parameters have been averaged and binned into 1 x 1 deg grid cells, from -180.0 to +180.0 deg longitude and from -90.0 to +90.0 deg latitude. For each grid map of 4-byte floating-point mean values there is a corresponding 4-byte floating-point map of standard deviation and a 2-byte integer grid map of counts. The counts map provides the user with the number of points per bin that were included in the mean and can be used to generate custom multi-day maps from the daily gridded products. The thermodynamic parameters are: Skin Temperature (land and sea surface), Air Temperature at the surface, Profiles of Air Temperature and Water Vapor, Tropopause Characteristics, Column Precipitable Water, Cloud Amount/Frequency, Cloud Height, Cloud Top Pressure, Cloud Top Temperature, Reflectance, Emissivity, Surface Pressure, Cloud Vertical Distribution. The trace gases parameters are: Total Amounts and Vertical Profiles of Carbon Monoxide, Methane, and Ozone.

DORIS is a dual-frequency Doppler system consisting of a receiver flying aboard a satellite and a globally distributed network of ground beacons. The DORIS receiver on-board the orbiting satellite tracks the dual-frequency radio signals transmitted by the network of ground beacons and generates the DORIS data. A measurement is made of either the Doppler shift or absolute phase as the satellite’s orbit moves over the ground-based beacon. DORIS data records contain a time-tagged range-rate measurement with associated ancillary information. The data records also contain information about any corrections that may have been applied during the processing phase, such as for the ionosphere, troposphere, and satellite center of mass, among others. Furthermore, meteorological measurements (e.g., temperature, relative humidity, ground pressure) recorded by instruments co-located with the ground-based beacons are included with the DORIS data and can be used to determine the tropospheric correction. DORIS data in the original format are also supplied to the data center in multi-day files, corresponding to the mission’s data processing arc, and are forwarded approximately 20 days after the end of the last observation day contained in the file. More information about these data is available on the CDDIS website at "

California Pronghorn Likely Tables Annual Range - Catalog,https://catalog.data.gov//dataset/california-pronghorn-likely-tables-annual-range,"The Likely Tables herd contains migrants, but this herd does not migrate between traditional summer and winter seasonal ranges. Instead, much of the herd displays a nomadic tendency, slowly migrating north for the summer using various high use areas as they move. Therefore, annual ranges were modeled using year-round data to demarcate high use areas in lieu modeling specific winter ranges. A high use area being used during winter by many of the collared animals is west of the Warner Mountains, east of U.S. Highway 395, and north of Moon Lake. Some animals live in the agricultural fields west of U.S. Highway 395. There appears to be little if any movement across the highway, which is fenced on both sides in this area. Summer ranges are spread out, with some individuals moving as far north as Goose Lake. A few outliers in the herd moved long distances south toward the Lassen herd or east to Nevada. Drought, increasing fire frequency, invasive annual grasses, and juniper encroachment negatively affect pronghorn habitat. Recent population surveys indicate a declining population (Trausch and others, 2020). Juniper removal on public and private lands have potential to improve habitat quality and potentially reduce predation (Ewanyk, 2020). Fences on public and private lands affect movement corridors and increase crossing and/or migration times. Recent fence modifications on BLM lands have shown potential to ease pronghorn movements (Hudgens, 2022).
These mapping layers show the location of the annual range for pronghorn (Antilocapra americana) in the Likely Tables population in California. They were developed from 25 sequences collected from a sample size of 20 animals comprising GPS locations collected every 1-4 hours."
Laboratory Evaluation of Phototaxis in Cultured Cisco Larvae - Catalog,https://catalog.data.gov//dataset/laboratory-evaluation-of-phototaxis-in-cultured-cisco-larvae,"Field observations in a Lake Ontario embayment suggested that there is a phototaxic response of larval cisco that changes with development. This switch was verified using cultured cisco in a laboratory environment. These data include counts of cisco larvae at three depth ranges within multiple 95 liter tanks. Each tank of larvae were exposed to one of three different light treatments with three replicate tanks per treatment. Light treatments were 24 hours per day of light exposure, 24 hours per day in darkness, and a 12-hour light then 12-hour dark exposure cycle. Observations of cisco positioning within the water column were recorded periodically. The information collected included the date and time of the observation, age of larvae at the time of the observation, and the count of larvae at each depth range at the time of the observation. Observations were recorded over 31 days."
California Pronghorn Clear Lake Migration Stopovers - Catalog,https://catalog.data.gov//dataset/california-pronghorn-clear-lake-migration-stopovers,"The Clear Lake herd contains migrants, but this herd does not migrate between traditional summer and winter seasonal ranges. Instead, much of the herd displays a nomadic tendency, slowly migrating north, east, or south for the summer using various high use areas as they move. Therefore, annual ranges were modeled using year-round data to demarcate high use areas in lieu of modeling specific winter ranges. The areas adjacent to Clear Lake Reservoir were heavily used during winter by many of the collared animals. A few collared individuals persisted west of State Route 139 year-round, seemingly separated from the rest of the herd due to this highway barrier. However, some pronghorn cross this road near Cornell and join this subgroup. Summer ranges are spread out, with many individuals moving southeast through protected forests or over the state border into Oregon. A few outliers in the herd moved long distances south, crossing State Route 139 to Oak Ridge, or east into Likely Tables pronghorn herd areas. Drought, increasing fire frequency, invasive annual grasses, and juniper encroachment negatively affect pronghorn habitat. Recent population surveys indicate a declining population (Trausch and others, 2020). Juniper removal on public and private lands has potential to improve habitat quality and potentially reduce predation (Ewanyk, 2020).

LANDFIRE 2022 Scott and Burgan Fire Behavior Fuel Model (FBFM40) HI - Catalog,https://catalog.data.gov//dataset/landfire-2022-scott-and-burgan-fire-behavior-fuel-model-fbfm40-hi,"LANDFIRE's (LF) 2022 40 Scott and Burgan Fire Behavior Fuel Models (FBFM40) product represents distinct distributions of fuel loadings found among surface fuel components (live and dead), size classes, and fuel types (Scott & Burgan 2005). The fuel models are described by the most common fire carrying fuel type (grass, brush, timber, or slash), loading and surface area-to-volume ratio by size class and component, fuel bed depth, and moisture of extinction. FBFM40 contains more fuel models for every fuel type than 13 Anderson Fire Behavior Fuel Models (FBFM13), and the number of fuel models representing relatively high dead fuel moisture content is increased. In FBFM40 fuel models with an herbaceous component are dynamic, to simulate curing, rather than remaining constant. To create this product, expert rulesets were developed to understand how different types of disturbance would change pre-disturbance fuel models to post disturbance fuels, based on the severity and time since disturbance. These rulesets are represented in the LF Total Fuel Change Tool and Database for both disturbed and non-disturbed areas. In the LF 2022 update, non-disturbed fuels are the same as LF 2016 Remap for natural vegetation. 
To designate disturbed areas where FBFM40 is modified, the aggregated Annual Disturbance products from 2013 to 2022 in the Fuel Disturbance (FDist) product are used. All existing disturbances between 2013-2022 are represented in the LF 2022 update, and the products are intended to be used in 2023 (the year of release). The ""capable"" year terminology used in LF 2020 and LF 2016 Remap is no longer specified, due to reduction in latency from when a disturbance occurs to the release date of fuel products accounting for that disturbance.

Washington Mule Deer Wenatchee Winter Range - Catalog,https://catalog.data.gov//dataset/washington-mule-deer-wenatchee-winter-range,"The Wenatchee Mountains mule deer herd inhabits a matrix of private and public lands along the eastern slope of the Cascade Range in Chelan and Kittitas Counties in Washington (fig. 24). Historically, the Wenatchee Mountains mule deer herd was separated into two subherds, Chelan and Kittitas; however, recent GPS collar data indicated the mule deer south of U.S. Highway 2 and north of Interstate 90 represent one population. Their high-use winter range extends along the foothills west and south of Wenatchee, Washington and throughout the foothills of the Kittitas Valley near Ellensburg. Their low-use winter range occurs along the foothills west of the Columbia River north of Interstate 90. In the spring, migratory individuals travel west into the Wenatchee Mountains to their summer range, which includes regional wilderness areas.
Between 2020 and 2021, collaring efforts focused on the foothills near Wenatchee and in the surrounding foothills near Ellensburg. Collar data analysis indicated the Wenatchee Mountains mule deer population is partially migratory. A high proportion of migratory individuals inhabit the northern winter range of the Wenatchee Mountains, and resident individuals more commonly inhabit the foothills of the Kittitas Valley. In 2022, collaring efforts of mule deer (n=25) in the northern winter range foothills near Wenatchee targeted the higher proportion of the migratory population, to more clearly identify the movement corridors intersecting U.S. Highway 97 near Blewett Pass. The herd has several challenges, including the increasing frequency of large-scale wildfires and residential developments, which continue to degrade and reduce available winter habitat. Disturbance from human recreation on the winter range continues to be a concern. Additionally, U.S. Highway 97 and State Route 970 receive high volumes of traffic in the region and present semipermeable barriers to spring and fall migration.
These mapping layers show the location of the winter ranges for mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus) in the Wenatchee population in Washington. They were developed from 151 migration sequences collected from a sample size of 97 animals comprising GPS locations collected every 4 hours."
Oregon Mule Deer Klamath Basin Stopovers - Catalog,https://catalog.data.gov//dataset/oregon-mule-deer-klamath-basin-stopovers,"The Klamath Basin mule deer herd contains an estimated 10,775 deer and features a mix of resident and migratory animals. Most winter ranges are adjacent to the California border near Bly and Lost River, California, in areas featuring western juniper, low shrublands, and early shrub-tree habitat. In spring, these mule deer either migrate northwest to regional national forest lands or northeast past South Fork Sprague River. Summer ranges contain ponderosa pine, mixed-conifer, and early shrub-tree habitat along with alfalfa and other agricultural crops. Notably, one mule deer migrated southeast into California near Goose Lake in May 2019 and spent a year near Deadhorse Reservoir before returning to Oregon in November 2020. Out of four mule deer outfitted with GPS collars during a separate capturing event, one migrates from Lake Albert to Lakeview, Oregon along U.S. Route 395 in spring. This stretch of U.S. Route 395 experienced an average annual daily traffic (AADT) value of 1,002 vehicles in 2018. Several other mule deer also cross sections of U.S. Highway 97, an even busier road that had an AADT value of 5,298 vehicles in 2018. From 2010 to 2022, ODOT recorded an average 65.7 mule deer-vehicle collisions per year along a 44.8 mi (72.1 km) section of U.S. Highway 97 north of Klamath Falls. Klamath Basin mule deer numbers are slowly declining, in part due to reduced summer forage quality (Peek and others, 2002). Forest fire suppression beginning in the 1920s increased canopy closure in the summer range, reducing preferred understory vegetation such as Purshia tridentata (antelope bitterbrush) and Ceanothus velutinus (snowbrush ceanothus). Without sufficient high-quality forage during drought years, mule deer become more reliant on agricultural fields near Klamath Falls as a dependable water source. Canopy closure also contributed to the severity of the 2021 Bootleg Fire, the third largest recorded fire in Oregon, which burned 413,765 acres (167,445 ha) north of Sprague River.
These mapping layers show the location of the stopovers for mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus) in the Klamath Basin population in Oregon. They were developed from 24 migration sequences collected from a sample size of 11 animals comprising GPS locations collected every 5−13 hours."

Nevada Mule Deer Area 17-Toiyabe Routes - Catalog,https://catalog.data.gov//dataset/nevada-mule-deer-area-17-toiyabe-routes,"The Area 17-Toiyabe mule deer herd inhabits the Shoshone Mountains and Toiyabe Range, which run north to south in central Nevada (fig. 11). Mule deer from the Shoshone Mountains and Toiyabe Range are characterized by short distance migrations from high elevations above 7,874 ft (2,400 m), down to 5,577 ft (1,700 m). Since the 1920s, the lower elevation slopes east of Toiyabe Dome, between Wisconsin Creek and Broad Creek and locally known as Toiyabe bench, have been documented by the Nevada Department of Wildlife as crucial mule deer winter range. Because of the value of this habitat for mule deer, the BLM closed the area to domestic livestock grazing in 1983 (Nevada Department of Wildlife, 1985). In 2018, in collaboration with Nevada Department of Wildlife, the FS treated 2,600 acres (647 ha) of pinyon and juniper—thinning the woody vegetation wherever they encroached shrublands—on the crucial mule deer wintering habitat (Gundlach, 2022). Other pinyon and juniper treatments are ongoing in Indian Valley, an area of high importance for year-round mule deer habitat between the Shoshone Mountains and Toiyabe Range. Senescent browse, reduced forbs, drought, and pinyon and juniper encroachment are the greatest conservation challenges the Area 17-Toiyabe mule deer herd face.
These mapping layers show the location of the Migration routes for mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus) in the Area 17-Toiyabe population in Nevada. They were developed from 98 migration sequences collected from a sample size of 35 animals comprising GPS locations collected every 2−5 hours."

The fraction of population using septic systems in 1990 was aggregated at the county scale and applied backward in time for each decade from 1850 to 1980. For decades from 1990 to 2010, the fraction of population using septic systems was computed on the finer resolution census block-group scale. Each decadal estimate of the fraction of population using septic systems was then multiplied by 4.13 kilograms per person per year of leached nitrate to estimate the per-area load of nitrate below the root zone.

For each data product included, summaries (averages or totals) are presented for multiple climate models or specific global warming levels and are average dover two time periods: 2040-2069, or the “2050s”, for near-term decision framing; and 2070-2099, or the “2080s”, for longer-term decision framing. In all cases where possible, both moderate emissions (RCP4.5 or +2C global level) and higher emissions (RCP8.5, or +4C global level) are presented. These choices (model averaging, temporal averaging, and scenario presentation) are tailored to the main sources of uncertainty (Hawkins and Sutton 2009) in climate model projections, specifically differences in climate model construction, climatic variability, and emissions scenario uncertainty (e.g., Littell et al. 2011, Snover et al. 2013, Terando et al. 2020). Not all scenario planning or climate impacts modeling needs can be met with these projections – these are intended to characterize a range of futures indicated by the available data products and facilitate further exploration of climate impacts modeling and adaptation development options."

EVC is mapped as continuous estimates of canopy cover for tree, shrub, and herbaceous lifeforms with a potential range from 10% to 100%. Continuous EVC values are binned to align with fuel model assignments when creating FVC. FVC is an input for fuel transitions related to disturbance. Fuel products in LF 2022 were created with LF 2016 Remap vegetation in non-disturbed areas. 
To designate disturbed areas where FVC is modified, the aggregated Annual Disturbance products from 2013 to 2022 in the Fuel Disturbance (FDist) product are used. All existing disturbances between 2013-2022 are represented in the LF 2022 update, and the products are intended to be used in 2023 (the year of release). The ""capable"" year terminology used in LF 2020 and LF 2016 Remap is no longer specified, due to reduction in latency from when a disturbance occurs to the release date of fuel products accounting for that disturbance. However, users should still consider adjusting fuel layers for disturbances that occurred after the end of the 2022 fiscal year (after October 1st, 2022) when using the LF 2022 fuel products.

Wyoming Wind River Reservation Elk Wind River Routes - Catalog,https://catalog.data.gov//dataset/wyoming-wind-river-reservation-elk-wind-river-routes,"The eastern slope of the Wind River Range provides habitat to approximately 4,000–5,000 migratory elk. The Wind River Elk herd winters on the Wind River Reservation managed under the sovereignty of the Eastern Shoshone Tribe and the Northern Arapaho Tribe of the Wind River Reservation, Wyoming (fig. 37). In spring, the herd migrates up in elevation to a roadless area established by the Tribes in the late 1930s—decades before The Wilderness Act of 1964 (Public Law 88-577, 16 U.S.C. 1131-1136) —or to adjacent FS lands. Many of the migration routes are along waterways with significant cultural heritage, including petroglyphs in the Dinwoody-style and areas connected to stories of sacred figures and occurrences (Wind River Visitors Council, 2022). Elk are a prominent part of ongoing Tribal cultural and language revitalization efforts. Collared elk migrate through areas on Arrow Mountain and cross historical hunting pits and drive lines used by Native peoples thousands of years ago and still exist today. The herd is actively hunted by Tribal members per a harvest regulation code (Nickerson, 2019; Public Law 86-634m 86th Congress, H.R. 4386). The terrain ranges from 6,000 ft (1,829 m) to 12,000 ft (3,658 m), but most elk summer at elevations below 11,000 ft (3,353 m). Foothill habitats include grass and sage, whereas the rocky Wind River Range contains alpine, lodgepole pine forests, mixed grass-conifer basins and ridges, and Salix spp. (willow)-lined creeks. The foothills have minimal development, except for irrigation infrastructure at Bull Lake and Washakie Reservoir and fenced ranches near Crowheart. Elk routinely winter in the remote foothills of the Wind River Range and near the more developed areas of Boulder Flats, Fort Washakie, and Lander. However, near Crowheart Butte and Bighorn Flat, groups of elk sometimes cross U.S. Highways 26 and 287 to the north or east, putting them at risk for wildlife-vehicle mortality.
These mapping layers show the location of the migration routes for Elk (Cervus canadensis) in the Wind River population in the Wind River Reservation. They were developed from 140 migration sequences collected from a sample size of 30 animals comprising GPS locations collected approximately every 1 hour."

The LOCA climate scenarios span water years 1950 to 2099 with greenhouse-gas forcings beginning in 2006. The LOCA downscaling method has been shown to produce better estimates of extreme events and reduces the common downscaling problem of too many low-precipitation days (Pierce et al., 2014). Ten GCMs were selected from the full ensemble of models from the fifth Coupled Model Intercomparison Project from the World Climate Research Programme (CMIP5) based on GCM historical performance to address specific needs for California water-resource planning (California Department of Water Resources Climate Change Technical Advisory Group, 2015). The 10 GCMs with RCP 4.5 and 8.5 each were statistically downscaled using the LOCA method (Pierce et al., 2014) from 2-degree (approximately 222-kilometer; km) quadrangles to 6-km resolution. Next, the scenarios were spatially downscaled from 6 km to 270 meters (Flint and Flint, 2012) and run through the BCMv8 using the same model parameters and input files as the historical BCM model (BCMv8; Flint et al., 2021).
Downscaled gridded climate variables include precipitation (ppt), minimum temperature (tmn), maximum temperature (tmx), and potential evapotranspiration (pet). Gridded hydrologic variables include: actual evapotranspiration (aet), climatic water deficit (cwd), snowpack (pck), recharge (rch), runoff (run), and soil storage (str). The units for temperature variables are degrees Celsius, and all other variables are in millimeters per month. Monthly variables from water years 1951 to 2099 are summarized into water year files (for example, water year 1951 includes October 1950 - September 1951) and 30-year average summaries from 1951 to 2099. Raster grids are in the NAD83 California Teale Albers, (meters) projection in an open format ascii text file (*.asc).

The fuel models are described by the most common fire carrying fuel type (grass, brush, timber, or slash), loading and surface area-to-volume ratio by size class and component, fuel bed depth, and moisture of extinction. LF FBFM13 can be used for fire spread related characteristic models. To create this product, expert rulesets were developed to understand how different types of disturbance would change pre-disturbance fuel models to post disturbance fuels, based on the severity and time since disturbance. These rulesets are represented in the LF Total Fuel Change Tool and Database. In the LF 2022 update, non-disturbed fuels are the same as LF 2016 Remap for natural vegetation.

Beach foreshore slope for the West Coast of the United States - Catalog,https://catalog.data.gov//dataset/beach-foreshore-slope-for-the-west-coast-of-the-united-states,"This data release contains foreshore slopes for primarily open-ocean sandy beaches along the west coast of the United States (California, Oregon and Washington). The slopes were calculated while extracting shoreline position from lidar point cloud data collected between 2002 and 2011. The shoreline positions have been previously published, but the slopes have not. A reference baseline was defined and then evenly-spaced cross-shore beach transects were created. Then all data points within 1 meter of each transect were associated with each transect. Next, it was determined which points were one the foreshore, and then a linear regression was fit through the foreshore points. Beach slope was defined as the slope of the regression. Finally, the regression was evaluated at the elevation of Mean High Water (MHW) to yield the location of the shoreline.  In some areas there was more than one lidar survey available; in these areas the slopes from each survey are provided. While most of the slopes are for sandy beaches, there is some slope data from rocky headlands and other steeper beaches.
These data files (slopeData_WestCoast.csv and slopeData_WestCoast.shp) contain beach slope, the location the beach slope data was calculated (the shoreline position), and the estimated uncertainty of the shoreline position. The accompanying data files (referenceLine_WestCoast.csv and referenceLine_WestCoast.shp) contain information about the reference baseline, the cross shore transects, and the MHW values used to estimate the shoreline location.

From 2021-2023, the EDM metabarcoding program conducted pilot studies to determine the best approach for implementing a long-term multi-taxa geneomic monitoring program. Research objectives included the utility of using ethanol decant from ichthyoplankton (larval fish) samples for eDNA metabarcoding analysis along with a comparison against eDNA analysis from water filtration samples. The results from these years of experimental research has guided the EDM program to build a protocol around point water filtration eDNA samples. This multi-year eDNA project is the groundwork for what will become the EDM metabarcoding monitoring program at high priority AIS locations across the Great Lakes basin. The protocol and database for these slight variations of eDNA metabarcoding data collection are made available in this reference record. Data collected in 2021 and 2022 are in the same general format and within a single database. Data from 2023, because of the variation from 2021/2022, is in a separate database. Again, each year of these databases represents slightly different protocols or objectives that were determined prior to sample collection. However, the taxonomic assignment results underwent a similar pipeline each year. "

This data set contains cases for locatable minerals under plan level operations with the case disposition of 'Authorized' or 'Pending'.Each case is given a data quality score based on how well it mapped.  These can be lumped into seven groups to provide a simplified way to understand the scores.Group 1: Direct PLSS Match. Scores “0”, “1”, “2”, “3” should all have a match to the PLSS data. There are slight differences, but the primary expectation is that these match the PLSS. Group 2: Calculated PLSS Match. Scores “4”, “4.1”, “5”, “6”, “7” and “8” were generated through a process of creating the geometry that is not a direct capture from the PLSS. They represent a best guess based on the underlining PLSS Group 3 – Mapped to Section. Score of “8.1”, “8.2”, “8.3”, “9” and “10” are mapped to the Section for various reasons (refer to log information in data quality field). Group 4- Combination of mapped and unmapped areas. Score of 15 represents a case that has some portions that would map and others that do not. Group 5 – No NLSDB Geometry, Only Attributes. Scores “11”, “12”, “20”, “21” and “22” do not have a match to the PLSS and no geometry is in the NLSDB, and only attributes exist in the data. Group 6 – Mapped to County.

Because the data readiness varies between Forests, each Forest will approve which level of attribute subset are published for that forest. Forests can provide no information or one of three attribute subsets describing trails. The attribute subsets include TrailNFS_Centerline which includes the location and trail name and number; TrailNFS_Basic which adds information about basic trail characteristics; and TrailNFS_Mgmt which adds information about where and when users are prohibited, allowed, and encouraged. When a Forest chooses to provide the highest attribute subset, TrailNFS_Mgmt, these attributes must be consistent with the Forest's published Motorized Vehicle Use Map (MVUM).

BLM ID Range Improvement Line - Catalog,https://catalog.data.gov//dataset/blm-id-range-improvement-line-hub,"This geodatabase of point, line and polygon features is an effort to consolidate all of the range improvement locations on BLM-managed land in Idaho into one database. Currently, the line feature class has some data for all of the BLM field offices except the Coeur d'Alene and Cottonwood field offices. Range improvements are structures intended to enhance rangeland resources, including wildlife, watershed, and livestock management. Examples of range improvements include water troughs, spring headboxes, culverts, fences, water pipelines, gates, wildlife guzzlers, artificial nest structures, reservoirs, developed springs, corrals, exclosures, etc. These structures were first tracked by the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) in the Job Documentation Report (JDR) System in the early 1960s, which was predominately a paper-based tracking system. In 1988 the JDRs were migrated into and replaced by the automated Range Improvement Project System (RIPS), and version 2.0 is currently being used today. It tracks inventory, status, objectives, treatment, maintenance cycle, maintenance inspection, monetary contributions and reporting. Not all range improvements are documented in the RIPS database; there may be some older range improvements that were built before the JDR tracking system was established. There also may be unauthorized projects that are not in RIPS. Official project files of paper maps, reports, NEPA documents, checklists, etc., document the status of each project and are physically kept in the office with management authority for that project area. In addition, project data is entered into the RIPS system to enable managers to access the data to track progress, run reports, analyze the data, etc. Before Geographic Information System technology most offices kept paper atlases or overlay systems that mapped the locations of the range improvements. The objective of this geodatabase is to migrate the location of historic range improvement projects into a GIS for geospatial use with other data and to centralize the range improvement data for the state. This data set is a work in progress and does not have all range improvement projects that are on BLM lands. Some field offices have not migrated their data into this database, and others are partially completed. New projects may have been built but have not been entered into the system. Historic or unauthorized projects may not have case files and are being mapped and documented as they are found. Many field offices are trying to verify the locations and status of range improvements with GPS, and locations may change or projects that have been abandoned or removed on the ground may be deleted. Attributes may be incomplete or inaccurate. This data was created using the standard for range improvements set forth in Idaho IM 2009-044, dated 6/30/2009.

These data were collected and processed as part of the School Attendance Boundary Survey (SABS) project which was funded by NCES to create geography delineating school attendance boundaries. Original source information that was used to create these boundary files were collected were collected over a web-based self-reporting system, through e-mail, and mailed paper maps. The web application provided instructions and assistance to users via a user guide, a frequently asked questions document, and instructional videos. Boundaries supplied outside of the online reporting system typically fell into one of six categories: a digital geographic file, such as a shapefile or KML file; digital image files, such as jpegs and pdfs; narrative descriptions; an interactive web map; Excel or pdf address lists; and paper maps. 2015 TIGER/line features (that consist of streets, hydrography, railways, etc.) were used to digitize school attendance boundaries and was the primary source of information used to digitize analog information. This practice works well as most school attendance boundaries align with streets, railways, water bodies and similar line features included in the 2015 TIGER/line ""edges"" files. In those few cases in which a portion of a school attendance boundary serves both sides of a street contractor staff used Esri’s Imagery base map to estimate the property lines of parcels. The data digitized from analog maps and verbal descriptions do not conform to cadastral data (and many of the original GIS files created by school districts do not conform with cadastral or parcel data).The SABS 2015-2016 file uses the WGS 1984 Web Mercator Auxiliary Sphere coordinate system.Additional information about SABS can be found on the EDGE website.The SABS dataset is intended for research purposes only and 
reflects a single snapshot in time. School boundaries frequently change 
from year to year. To verify legal descriptions of boundaries, users 
must contact the school district directly.All information contained in this file is in the public domain. Data users are advised to review NCES program documentation and feature class metadata to understand the limitations and appropriate use of these data."

The Census Bureau calculates the income-to-poverty ratio (IPR) based on money income reported for families relative to the poverty thresholds, which are determined based on the family size and structure. Noncash benefits (such as food stamps and housing subsidies) are excluded, as are capital gains and losses. The IPR is the percentage of family income that is above or below the federal poverty level. The IPR indicator ranges from 0 to a top-coded value of 999. A family with income at the poverty threshold has an IPR value of 100.

California Pronghorn Lassen Migration Corridors - Catalog,https://catalog.data.gov//dataset/california-pronghorn-lassen-migration-corridors,"The Lassen herd winters in lower elevations in the Secret Valley, Bull Flat, and the Five Springs Wilderness Study Area north of the Skedaddle Mountains and east of Shaffer Mountain, as well as in the Dry Valley Rim Wilderness Study Area. Summer ranges are spread out, with some individuals migrating north to the Madeline Plains and others heading west to Willow Creek Valley, Grasshopper Valley, and Eagle Lake (fig. XXX). An unknown portion of the herd are better characterized as residents. The primary threat to pronghorn in the Lassen herd is the conversion of perennial shrublands to exotic annual grasslands following wildfires. The 2012 Rush Fire burned 271,911 acres in Lassen County within the boundary of the Lassen herd, expanding invasive annual grasslands with altered fire regimes which increase fire frequency and promote the further expansion of exotic grasses. Overabundant free-roaming equids, feral horses and burros, regularly exceed the appropriate management level of the Twin Peaks Herd Management Area, thereby reducing forage and water available for pronghorn. The expansion of juniper into the shrub steppe limits the amount of forage available for pronghorn while increasing the risk of mountain lion predation. The population has been stable to slightly increasing since the 1992-1993 winter die off in northeast California, averaging 974 animals counted during aerial winter surveys (B. Ehler, California Department of Fish and Wildlife, written commun., 2023). CDFW is planning to mark 35 pronghorn with GPS collars in winter 2024 to estimate the population using mark resight surveys.

The herd contains resident and migratory elk; migrants travel an average 10.7 mi (17.2 km) one way. Elevations range from 6,000 ft (1,829 m) at Wind River near Crowheart to 12,200 ft (3,700 m) in the Absaroka Range, and summits in the Owl Creek Mountains reach 8,000–9,800 ft (2,438–2,987 m). Habitats range from sage and desert scrub in the lowlands surrounding the Wind River Range to upland meadows, aspen groves, Pinus contorta (lodgepole pine) forests, and alpine tundra. When on the Wind River Reservation, the elk are under the sovereignty of the Eastern Shoshone Tribe and Northern Arapaho Tribe of the Wind River Reservation, Wyoming. During spring migration, some of the elk cross the East Fork Wind River to FS lands. Other migrations are entirely in the reservation, including the upper tributaries near Washakie Needles, or the Owl Creek Mountains. Residents in the herd also use the Owl Creek Mountains, particularly the portion east of Blondy Pass. Many areas contain significant evidence of past hunting and ceremonial activity, and according to Shoshone ethnography, elk were significant game acquisition in the prereservation era of the 1800s (Shimkin, 1947). This elk herd remains culturally and economically valuable to Tribal members who sustainably harvest elk under a game code established in 1984 (Nickerson, 2019; Public Law 86-634m 86th Congress, H.R. 4386). Habitats are virtually free of human disturbance and development aside from Tribal member livestock grazing and a few Tribal-owned and operated oilfields in the desert winter range. Threats to habitat include drought and climate change or biological invasions of nonnative cheat grass and feral horses contributing to poor range conditions. In 2022, Tribes started working in partnership with the Wind River Agency of Bureau of Indian Affairs, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Wyoming Game and Fish Department, Wyoming Legislature, Wyoming Livestock Board, and the Wild Sheep Foundation to reduce the feral horse population and design projects to restore habitats to greater productivity (Kikonow, 2023).
These mapping layers show the location of the Migration routes for Elk (Cervus canadensis) in the Owl Creek population in Wind River Reservation. They were developed from 77 migration sequences collected from a sample size of 16 animals comprising GPS locations collected every 1 hour."

Mule deer from the Shoshone Mountains and Toiyabe Range are characterized by short distance migrations from high elevations above 7,874 ft (2,400 m), down to 5,577 ft (1,700 m). Since the 1920s, the lower elevation slopes east of Toiyabe Dome, between Wisconsin Creek and Broad Creek and locally known as Toiyabe bench, have been documented by the Nevada Department of Wildlife as crucial mule deer winter range. Because of the value of this habitat for mule deer, the BLM closed the area to domestic livestock grazing in 1983 (Nevada Department of Wildlife, 1985). In 2018, in collaboration with Nevada Department of Wildlife, the FS treated 2,600 acres (647 ha) of pinyon and juniper—thinning the woody vegetation wherever they encroached shrublands—on the crucial mule deer wintering habitat (Gundlach, 2022). Other pinyon and juniper treatments are ongoing in Indian Valley, an area of high importance for year-round mule deer habitat between the Shoshone Mountains and Toiyabe Range. Senescent browse, reduced forbs, drought, and pinyon and juniper encroachment are the greatest conservation challenges the Area 17-Toiyabe mule deer herd face.

Oregon Mule Deer Trout Creek Stopovers - Catalog,https://catalog.data.gov//dataset/oregon-mule-deer-trout-creek-stopovers,"The Trout Creek mule deer herd is composed of residents and migrants that make short-range elevational migrations. Mule deer mainly winter at lower elevations surrounding Blue Mountain and the slopes of the Oregon Canyon Mountains. In spring, some of these mule deer migrate to higher elevations in the Oregon Canyon Mountains. Other members of the herd winter in the southwestern portion of the herd’s range, inhabiting areas near Hawks Mountain, the Pueblo Mountains, and the foothills of the Trout Creek Mountains. These mule deer migrate to summer ranges on the crests of Holloway Mountain and the Trout Creek Mountains. Notably, one mule deer formerly wintering on the Trout Creek Mountains migrated south from a summer range on the Nevada border to the Montana Mountains during the second documented winter before returning to Oregon in spring. Habitat on winter ranges consists of A. t. wyomingensis (Wyoming big sagebrush) plant communities and non-native annual grasslands. Summer ranges consist mainly of native grasslands, mountain big sagebrush plant communities, and mountain shrub communities. 
The Trout Creek mule deer herd faces several threats, including summer wildfires, highway barriers, and competition for resources. In 2012, the Holloway fire burned 462,017 acres (186,972 ha) including most of the Trout Creek and Oregon Canyon Mountains, resulting in the temporary loss of shrub cover at higher elevations and conversion of native forbs and shrubland to invasive annual grasses at lower elevations. Although no migratory mule deer attempt to cross U.S. Highway 95, some resident mule deer have ranges spanning the busy highway, which had an AADT value of 2,095 vehicles in 2018. The Trout Creek mule deer herd also borders the Barren Creek Complex HMA to the north and the Beaty Butte HMA to the east (DOI and BLM, 2020; BLM 2022). The Barren Creek Complex HMA contains approximately 2,500 feral horses while the Beaty Butte HMA contains 463 horses. Both feral horse populations surpass the respective maximum appropriate management levels of 892 and 250 horses, respectively, suggesting that mule deer and horses compete for resources in the few areas where ranges overlap.
These mapping layers show the location of the stopovers for mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus) in the Trout Creek population in Oregon. They were developed from 40 migration sequences collected from a sample size of 10 animals comprising GPS locations collected every 5 hours."

"Carbon Dioxide Storage Resources-Wind River Basin: Chapter O, Spatial Data - Catalog",https://catalog.data.gov//dataset/carbon-dioxide-storage-resources-wind-river-basin-chapter-o-spatial-data,"The storage assessment unit (SAU) is the fundamental unit used in the National Assessment of Geologic Carbon Dioxide Storage Resources project for the assessment of geologic CO2 storage resources. The SAU is shown here as a geographic boundary interpreted, defined, and mapped by the geologist responsible for the assessment interval. Individual SAUs are defined on the basis of common geologic and hydrologic characteristics. The resource that is assessed is the mass of CO2 that can be stored in the technically accessible pore volume of a storage formation. The technically accessible storage resource is one that may be available using present-day geological and engineering knowledge and technology for CO2 injection into geologic formations and therefore is not a total in-place resource estimate. The SAU boundary is defined geologically as the limits of the geologic elements that define the SAU, such as limits of reservoir rock, geologic structures, depth, and seal lithologies. The only exceptions to this are SAUs that border the international, or Federal-State water boundary. In these cases, the international or Federal-State water boundary forms part of the SAU boundary.
Drilling-density cell maps show the number of wells that have been drilled into the SAU. Each 1-square-mile cell has a count for the number of unique well boreholes drilled into the SAU. For a given sedimentary basin, the National Assessment of Geologic Carbon Dioxide Storage Resources project identifies SAUs containing the potential for storage and sequestration of carbon dioxide. Proprietary well header data from IHS ENERDEQ through 2010 were queried to determine which wells were drilled into specific SAUs. The coordinates of wells are proprietary and cannot be released; however, counts of the number of wells per square mile are presented in the well drilling density data layer."

Oregon Mule Deer Southeast Winter Ranges - Catalog,https://catalog.data.gov//dataset/oregon-mule-deer-southeast-winter-ranges,"Most of the Southeast mule deer herd winters along the Owyhee River in regions containing sagebrush communities and Columbia Basin grassland mixed with non-native annual grasslands. These mule deer either migrate west to summer ranges on Road Canyon and Gravel Ridges or east to the Owyhee Mountains along the Idaho border, with one mule deer migrating as far as Bald Mountain, 38.3 mi (61.6 km) into Idaho. Summer ranges feature shrubland, Columbia Basin grasslands, western juniper, and evergreen forests. In 2014, the Buzzard Complex fires burned 398,596 acres (161,306 ha), including Road Canyon, allowing medusahead and other non-native grasses to invade areas with originally low perennial plant abundance. Five mule deer winter separately near U.S. Route 95, in areas containing higher percentages of western juniper. In the spring, they travel southeast into Nevada to summer on the Santa Rosa Range, with one mule deer migrating to the Tuscarora Mountains. Of the Southeast mule deer that were tracked for at least 100 days, 82 percent migrate seasonally, with several moving to summer ranges in different states, complicating issues of population management. The Southeast mule deer herd faces several challenges, including highways and the low abundance of preferred browse. The northeastern section of U.S. Route 95 had an AADT value of 2,007 vehicles in 2018 and intersects multiple migration corridors, with mule deer commonly crossing the highway along Succor Creek and Rock Creek Flat. In summer, Southeast mule deer spend more time in riparian zones and must compete with grazing cattle in the Owyhee Mountains for high-quality forage during drought years when natural water sources evaporate. 
These mapping layers show the location of the winter ranges for mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus) in the Southeast population in Oregon. They were developed from 63 migration sequences collected from a sample size of 34 animals comprising GPS locations collected every 5−13 hours."
Oregon Mule Deer Northside Migration Corridors - Catalog,https://catalog.data.gov//dataset/oregon-mule-deer-northside-migration-corridors,"The winter ranges of the Northside mule deer herd can be broadly separated into northern and southern subgroups. The majority of the southern subgroup winters at low elevations near the John Day River in areas dominated by big sagebrush communities, Columbia Basin grasslands, and western juniper. The northern subgroup is more spatially dispersed, wintering by Cottonwood Creek, the North Fork John Day River, and the Middle Fork John Day River in ranges containing more conifer forest than those of the southern subgroup. Both subgroups summer in the same general area, migrating either northeast or southeast to reach ranges featuring mixed-conifer, Picea spp. (spruce), Ponderosa pine, and western juniper forests with scattered Columbia Basin grasslands on Deardorff Mountain, the Blue Mountains, and Elkhorn Ridge. Some mule deer west of the North Fork John Day River migrate north to reach summer ranges near Rock Creek. Interestingly, five mule deer migrated south, crossing the section of U.S. Route 26 that divides the Northside and Murderer’s Creek mule deer herds. Since U.S. Route 26 also separates resident mule deer from agricultural fields with reliable water sources, mule deer-vehicle collisions are common year-round, and this section experienced an annual average of 106 mule deer-vehicle collisions from 2016 to 2022. In 2010, the Heppner WMU, which is used for livestock grazing and contains multiple mule deer winter ranges, was included in the Oregon Mule Deer Initiative (ODFW, 2015, 2020). Since then, ODFW has removed 10,256.7 acres (4,150.7 ha) of invasive flora, reseeded 7,405.3 acres (2,996.8 ha) with native shrubs and grassland, and completed 48 water development projects.

California Pronghorn Clear Lake Migration Corridors - Catalog,https://catalog.data.gov//dataset/california-pronghorn-clear-lake-migration-corridors,"The Clear Lake herd contains migrants, but this herd does not migrate between traditional summer and winter seasonal ranges. Instead, much of the herd displays a nomadic tendency, slowly migrating north, east, or south for the summer using various high use areas as they move. Therefore, annual ranges were modeled using year-round data to demarcate high use areas in lieu of modeling specific winter ranges. The areas adjacent to Clear Lake Reservoir were heavily used during winter by many of the collared animals. A few collared individuals persisted west of State Route 139 year-round, seemingly separated from the rest of the herd due to this highway barrier. However, some pronghorn cross this road near Cornell and join this subgroup. Summer ranges are spread out, with many individuals moving southeast through protected forests or over the state border into Oregon. A few outliers in the herd moved long distances south, crossing State Route 139 to Oak Ridge, or east into Likely Tables pronghorn herd areas. Drought, increasing fire frequency, invasive annual grasses, and juniper encroachment negatively affect pronghorn habitat. Recent population surveys indicate a declining population (Trausch and others, 2020). Juniper removal on public and private lands has potential to improve habitat quality and potentially reduce predation (Ewanyk, 2020).
These mapping layers show the location of the migration corridors for pronghorn (Antilocapra americana) in the Clear Lake population in California. They were developed from 72 migration sequences collected from a sample size of 23 animals comprising GPS locations collected every 1-6 hours."

The algorithm makes use of predictors derived from individual ARD Landsat scenes, lagged reference conditions, and change metrics between the scene and reference conditions. Scene-level products include pixel-level burn probability (BP) and burn classification (BC) images, corresponding to each Landsat image in the ARD time series. Annual composite products are also available by summarizing the scene level products. Prior to generating annual composites, individual scenes that had > 0.010 burned proportion were visually assessed as part of a quality assurance check. Scenes with obvious commission errors were removed. The annual products include the maximum burn probability (BP), burn classification count (BC) or the number of scenes a pixel was classified as burned, filtered burn classification (BF) with burned areas persistent from the previous year removed, and the burn date (BD) or the Julian date of the first Landsat scene a burned areas was observed in. Vectorized versions of the BF raster are also provided as shapefiles (BF_labeled) with attributes including summary statistics of BC, BD, BP, as well as the majority level 3 ecoregion (Omernik and Griffith, 2014) and count of pixels by each National Land Cover Database Category (Vogelmann et al., 2001; Yang et al., 2018) for each burned area polygon.

California Mule Deer Mendocino Winter Range - Catalog,https://catalog.data.gov//dataset/california-mule-deer-mendocino-winter-range,"The Mendocino mule deer herd complex is comprised of three overlapping black-tailed deer (Odocoileus hemionus columbianus) administrative herds, including Mendocino, Clear Lake, and Alder Springs. Mendocino black-tailed deer exhibit variable movement patterns and strategies, including traditional seasonal migrants, full-time residents, and multi-range migrants. Migrants move between seasonal ranges from a multitude of lower elevation areas within the North Coast Range in winter to higher elevation summer ranges (fig. XXX). Local biologists predict high-use winter ranges throughout both foothill slopes and valley bottoms. Female deer of the Mendocino herd complex exhibit both short-term (seasonal/annual) and long-term (multi-generational) fidelity to their summer ranges (Bose and others, 2017). Population density estimates in 2011 and 2012 based on fecal DNA pellets indicated exceptionally high deer densities on productive summer ranges (50.75 deer/km2; Lounsberry and others, 2015). However, the population was declining strongly at the time of study due to low adult survival, including of prime-aged females (Marescot and others, 2015). Survival rates were lower than typically observed for mule deer populations across their range (Forrester and Wittmer, 2013). Predation from black bears (Ursus americanus) and coyotes (Canis latrans) was the primary cause for low annual survival of fawns (Forrester and Wittmer, 2019) while predation from pumas (Puma concolor) was the foremost cause of adult female mortality (Marescot and others, 2015), often in areas deemed less familiar to the individual mule deer (Forrester and others, 2015). Puma kill rates of mule deer in the study area were the highest reported across their range (Cristescu and others, 2022), likely due to high rates of kleptoparasitism from black bears (Elbroch and others, 2015; Allen and others, 2021). More recent research from CDFW was directed at the collection of DNA from fecal pellets to update population density estimates (CDFW, 2015) and to determine population response to catastrophic wildfire (CDFW, 2019; CAL FIRE, 2021). Habitat use of mule deer (Bose and others, 2018) and their predators (Cristescu and others, 2019) in the area is well understood and most of the habitats occupied by the Mendocino herd complex are protected and not at risk of development or fragmentation. However, the risk of catastrophic wildfire and climate changed induced landscape scale changes exist with the consequences unknown. 
These mapping layers show the location of the winter range for mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus) in the Mendocino population in California. They were developed from 65 winter sequences collected from a sample size of 45 animals comprising GPS locations collected every 1-13 hours."
Oregon Mule Deer Murderer's Creek Winter Ranges - Catalog,https://catalog.data.gov//dataset/oregon-mule-deer-murderers-creek-winter-ranges,"The Murderer’s Creek mule deer herd winters south of U.S. Route 26 in river valleys near Canyon Creek, Murderer’s Creek, and the South Fork John Day River. The herd’s winter ranges are characterized by western juniper, big sagebrush, and Columbia Basin grassland communities, with medusahead and other non-native grasses invading lower elevations. In the spring, mule deer mainly migrate southeast to summer ranges distributed throughout Gilbert Ridge and the Aldrich Mountains, some traveling as far south as Devon Ridge and east to Ironside Mountain. Summer ranges in these areas contain mixed-conifer forests, ponderosa pine, and low sagebrush communities. A smaller portion of this herd migrates northeast in the spring, crossing U.S. Route 26 to summer in the foothills of Long Creek Mountain, the Blue Mountains, and Elkhorn Ridge, in areas containing big sagebrush along with Populus tremuloides (quaking aspen), ponderosa pine, and mixed-conifer forests. 
In areas of low-quality browse, Murderer’s Creek mule deer that migrate or reside south of U.S. Route 26 can compete with feral horses, particularly during drought years. The Murderer’s Creek Herd Management Unit (HMA) currently contains 329 feral horses (BLM 2023), significantly more than the maximum appropriate management level of 140 horses (USFS, 2009). In 2010, the Murderer’s Creek Wildlife Management Unit (WMU), which overlaps the Murderer’s Creek HMA, was included in the Mule Deer Initiative to improve conditions for mule deer, primarily through habitat restoration (ODFW, 2011). Since 2010, ODFW has treated 17,295 acres (6,999 ha) for western juniper removal and reseeded 10,016 acres (4,053 ha) for native shrubs and grasses, in addition to temporarily closing 128 mi2 (332 km2) of road within the Flagtail Travel Management Area during hunting season (ODFW, 2015, 2020). In 2015, the Canyon Creek Complex fire burned 110,261 acres (44,621 ha) across the Aldrich Mountains, reducing canopy closure and further improving habitat in summer ranges. The number of Murderer’s Creek mule deer is now stable with a 2021 estimate of 5,568 mule deer (ODFW, 2021).
These mapping layers show the location of the winter ranges for mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus) in the Murderer's Creek population in Oregon. They were developed from 185 migration sequences collected from a sample size of 116 animals comprising GPS locations collected every 5−13 hours."
Nevada Mule Deer Area 17-Toiyabe Migration Corridors - Catalog,https://catalog.data.gov//dataset/nevada-mule-deer-area-17-toiyabe-migration-corridors,"The Area 17-Toiyabe mule deer herd inhabits the Shoshone Mountains and Toiyabe Range, which run north to south in central Nevada (fig. 11). Mule deer from the Shoshone Mountains and Toiyabe Range are characterized by short distance migrations from high elevations above 7,874 ft (2,400 m), down to 5,577 ft (1,700 m). Since the 1920s, the lower elevation slopes east of Toiyabe Dome, between Wisconsin Creek and Broad Creek and locally known as Toiyabe bench, have been documented by the Nevada Department of Wildlife as crucial mule deer winter range. Because of the value of this habitat for mule deer, the BLM closed the area to domestic livestock grazing in 1983 (Nevada Department of Wildlife, 1985). In 2018, in collaboration with Nevada Department of Wildlife, the FS treated 2,600 acres (647 ha) of pinyon and juniper—thinning the woody vegetation wherever they encroached shrublands—on the crucial mule deer wintering habitat (Gundlach, 2022). Other pinyon and juniper treatments are ongoing in Indian Valley, an area of high importance for year-round mule deer habitat between the Shoshone Mountains and Toiyabe Range. Senescent browse, reduced forbs, drought, and pinyon and juniper encroachment are the greatest conservation challenges the Area 17-Toiyabe mule deer herd face.
These mapping layers show the location of the Migration routes for mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus) in the Area 17-Toiyabe population in Nevada. They were developed from 98 migration sequences collected from a sample size of 35 animals comprising GPS locations collected every 2−5 hours."
Wyoming Wind River Reservation Elk Owl Creek Routes - Catalog,https://catalog.data.gov//dataset/wyoming-wind-river-reservation-elk-owl-creek-routes,"The Owl Creek elk herd, with 7,500–8,500 wintering elk, inhabits the northwest corner of the Wind River Reservation, traversing habitats along the Absaroka Range and the Owl Creek Mountains (fig. 36). The herd contains resident and migratory elk; migrants travel an average 10.7 mi (17.2 km) one way. Elevations range from 6,000 ft (1,829 m) at Wind River near Crowheart to 12,200 ft (3,700 m) in the Absaroka Range, and summits in the Owl Creek Mountains reach 8,000–9,800 ft (2,438–2,987 m). Habitats range from sage and desert scrub in the lowlands surrounding the Wind River Range to upland meadows, aspen groves, Pinus contorta (lodgepole pine) forests, and alpine tundra. When on the Wind River Reservation, the elk are under the sovereignty of the Eastern Shoshone Tribe and Northern Arapaho Tribe of the Wind River Reservation, Wyoming. During spring migration, some of the elk cross the East Fork Wind River to FS lands. Other migrations are entirely in the reservation, including the upper tributaries near Washakie Needles, or the Owl Creek Mountains. Residents in the herd also use the Owl Creek Mountains, particularly the portion east of Blondy Pass. Many areas contain significant evidence of past hunting and ceremonial activity, and according to Shoshone ethnography, elk were significant game acquisition in the prereservation era of the 1800s (Shimkin, 1947). This elk herd remains culturally and economically valuable to Tribal members who sustainably harvest elk under a game code established in 1984 (Nickerson, 2019; Public Law 86-634m 86th Congress, H.R. 4386). Habitats are virtually free of human disturbance and development aside from Tribal member livestock grazing and a few Tribal-owned and operated oilfields in the desert winter range. Threats to habitat include drought and climate change or biological invasions of nonnative cheat grass and feral horses contributing to poor range conditions. In 2022, Tribes started working in partnership with the Wind River Agency of Bureau of Indian Affairs, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Wyoming Game and Fish Department, Wyoming Legislature, Wyoming Livestock Board, and the Wild Sheep Foundation to reduce the feral horse population and design projects to restore habitats to greater productivity (Kikonow, 2023).

The population ranges between 4,000 and 5,000 animals and is partially migratory, with individuals displaying a mix of resident (63 percent of analyzed individuals) and migratory (34 percent of analyzed individuals) behaviors. During winter, many elk inhabit grassland, sagebrush, antelope bitterbrush, and ponderosa pine habitats in the Whiskey Dick, Quilomene, and Colockum Wildlife Areas and the eastern reaches of the Naneum State Forest. As spring green up of vegetation nears, migratory elk travel northwest toward summer ranges in the Wenatchee Mountains, north of Ellensburg. Resident elk inhabit the same areas as wintering migratory elk. Agricultural producers in the eastern Kittitas Valley often experience conflicts with elk consuming hay in fields. Additional concerns for the herd include semipermeable barriers along Interstate 90 and U.S. Highway 97 and disturbance from human recreation on the winter range.

Washington Mule Deer Klickitat Stopovers - Catalog,https://catalog.data.gov//dataset/washington-mule-deer-klickitat-stopovers,"The Klickitat mule deer herd inhabits the Columbia Hills and surrounding terrain to the north along the Columbia River, Washington (fig. 23). The Klickitat River is the western boundary of the herd and is part of a transition zone between black-tailed deer and mule deer distributions. Habitats in the western half of the herd’s range include Quercus garryana (Oregon white oak) mixed with Abies spp. (fir), pine, or grassland species. The western half of the herd’s range comprises a mix of public and private lands, including rangeland, farmland, and the Klickitat Wildlife Area, which has protected crucial winter range since the 1950s. Sagebrush steppe is more prevalent in the eastern half of the herd’s range with Quercus garryana Douglas ex Hook. (Oregon white oak) and ponderosa pine in drainages such as Rock Creek, which serves as a popular wintering area. Dryland wheat, rangeland, and viticulture are also common in the eastern half, which is mostly privately owned.
Klickitat mule deer are partially migratory with more residents in the eastern half of the herd’s range and a higher proportion of migrants in the western half of the herd’s range. As vegetation green up progresses during spring, migrants travel from low-elevation winter ranges to high-elevation summer ranges in the Cascade Range and Simcoe Mountains. Some individuals migrate short distances (5 mi [8 km]), especially mule deer in the eastern half of the herd’s range. Increasing residential development in the western half of the range and renewable energy development and conversion to viticulture in the eastern half of the range are the greatest concerns for winter ranges and migration corridors. Additionally, U.S. Highway 97 is a semipermeable barrier to migration with only one wildlife underpass, built in 2012.
These mapping layers show the location of the Migration stopovers for mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus) in the Klickitat population in Washington. They were developed from 78 migration sequences collected from a sample size of 103 animals comprising GPS locations collected every 4 hours."

Summer ranges are spread out, with some individuals migrating north to the Madeline Plains and others heading west to Willow Creek Valley, Grasshopper Valley, and Eagle Lake (fig. XXX). An unknown portion of the herd are better characterized as residents. The primary threat to pronghorn in the Lassen herd is the conversion of perennial shrublands to exotic annual grasslands following wildfires. The 2012 Rush Fire burned 271,911 acres in Lassen County within the boundary of the Lassen herd, expanding invasive annual grasslands with altered fire regimes which increase fire frequency and promote the further expansion of exotic grasses. Overabundant free-roaming equids, feral horses and burros, regularly exceed the appropriate management level of the Twin Peaks Herd Management Area, thereby reducing forage and water available for pronghorn. The expansion of juniper into the shrub steppe limits the amount of forage available for pronghorn while increasing the risk of mountain lion predation. The population has been stable to slightly increasing since the 1992-1993 winter die off in northeast California, averaging 974 animals counted during aerial winter surveys (B.

Arizona Elk South of Interstate 40 Corridors - Catalog,https://catalog.data.gov//dataset/arizona-elk-south-of-interstate-40-corridors,"South of Interstate 40 elk reside primarily in Arizona’s Game Management Unit (GMU) 8. Upon completing population surveys in 2021, approximately 4,000 elk were estimated to inhabit GMU 8. Their summer range is primarily characterized by high-elevation ponderosa pine forests and grasslands. The elk radiate out from various origin points within their summer range to their winter range, comprised of rims of canyons in the area, including Sycamore Canyon, Tule Canyon, and Government Canyon. This series of canyons creates an impermeable southern boundary for this herd. Their winter range along the rim country is primarily characterized by pinyon-juniper, manzanita, and scrub oak.
Interstate 40 is the primary threat to this herd’s migration corridor, limiting habitat connectivity and highway permeability between the South and North of Interstate 40 elk herds. Successful elk crossings of Interstate 40 are rare, and more than 65 elk-vehicle collisions occur along this stretch per year. To help mitigate this issue, an overpass is currently in the design phase, which will connect these two herds across Interstate 40.
These mapping layers show the location of the migration corridors for elk (Cervus canadensis) in the South of Interstate 40 population in Arizona. They were developed from 71 migration sequences collected from a sample size of 25 animals comprising GPS locations collected every 2 hours."

Nevada Mule Deer Spring Mountains Winter Range - Catalog,https://catalog.data.gov//dataset/nevada-mule-deer-spring-mountains-winter-range,"The Spring Mountains are critical habitat for the Spring Mountains mule deer herd in southern Nevada. The Spring Mountains west of Las Vegas, Nevada range in elevation from low meadows at 3,000 ft (910 m) to Charleston Peak at nearly 12,000 ft (3,632 m). Lower elevations are dominated by desert scrub and shrubland transitioning to Yucca brevifolia (Joshua tree) and pinyon-juniper forest at midelevations, with mixed montane conifer including ponderosa pine and Pinus longaeva (bristlecone pine) pine at higher elevations, and sparse alpine grasses and forbs above the tree line. The migratory behavior of the Spring Mountains mule deer herd is variable, with a mix of year-round residents and short-distance elevational migrants. Lovell Canyon serves as a well-used corridor between high-elevation summer range near Mount Charleston and low-elevation winter range near Mountain Springs (fig. 12). In 2020, a wildlife underpass was completed to facilitate movement across State Route 160 and reduce wildlife-vehicle collisions. Most of the land in the Spring Mountains is managed by the FS and the BLM and serves as a popular, year-round recreational destination. Encroaching development, prolonged drought conditions, wildfires, feral equids, and human recreation affect the persistence of the mule deer herd in the Spring Mountains.

Oregon Mule Deer Murderer's Creek Stopovers - Catalog,https://catalog.data.gov//dataset/oregon-mule-deer-murderers-creek-stopovers,"The Murderer’s Creek mule deer herd winters south of U.S. Route 26 in river valleys near Canyon Creek, Murderer’s Creek, and the South Fork John Day River. The herd’s winter ranges are characterized by western juniper, big sagebrush, and Columbia Basin grassland communities, with medusahead and other non-native grasses invading lower elevations. In the spring, mule deer mainly migrate southeast to summer ranges distributed throughout Gilbert Ridge and the Aldrich Mountains, some traveling as far south as Devon Ridge and east to Ironside Mountain. Summer ranges in these areas contain mixed-conifer forests, ponderosa pine, and low sagebrush communities. A smaller portion of this herd migrates northeast in the spring, crossing U.S. Route 26 to summer in the foothills of Long Creek Mountain, the Blue Mountains, and Elkhorn Ridge, in areas containing big sagebrush along with Populus tremuloides (quaking aspen), ponderosa pine, and mixed-conifer forests. 
In areas of low-quality browse, Murderer’s Creek mule deer that migrate or reside south of U.S. Route 26 can compete with feral horses, particularly during drought years. The Murderer’s Creek Herd Management Unit (HMA) currently contains 329 feral horses (BLM 2023), significantly more than the maximum appropriate management level of 140 horses (USFS, 2009). In 2010, the Murderer’s Creek Wildlife Management Unit (WMU), which overlaps the Murderer’s Creek HMA, was included in the Mule Deer Initiative to improve conditions for mule deer, primarily through habitat restoration (ODFW, 2011). Since 2010, ODFW has treated 17,295 acres (6,999 ha) for western juniper removal and reseeded 10,016 acres (4,053 ha) for native shrubs and grasses, in addition to temporarily closing 128 mi2 (332 km2) of road within the Flagtail Travel Management Area during hunting season (ODFW, 2015, 2020). In 2015, the Canyon Creek Complex fire burned 110,261 acres (44,621 ha) across the Aldrich Mountains, reducing canopy closure and further improving habitat in summer ranges. The number of Murderer’s Creek mule deer is now stable with a 2021 estimate of 5,568 mule deer (ODFW, 2021).
These mapping layers show the location of the stopovers for mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus) in the Murderer's Creek population in Oregon. They were developed from 274 migration sequences collected from a sample size of 101 animals comprising GPS locations collected every 5−13 hours."
Oregon Mule Deer Trout Creek Migration Corridors - Catalog,https://catalog.data.gov//dataset/oregon-mule-deer-trout-creek-migration-corridors,"The Trout Creek mule deer herd is composed of residents and migrants that make short-range elevational migrations. Mule deer mainly winter at lower elevations surrounding Blue Mountain and the slopes of the Oregon Canyon Mountains. In spring, some of these mule deer migrate to higher elevations in the Oregon Canyon Mountains. Other members of the herd winter in the southwestern portion of the herd’s range, inhabiting areas near Hawks Mountain, the Pueblo Mountains, and the foothills of the Trout Creek Mountains. These mule deer migrate to summer ranges on the crests of Holloway Mountain and the Trout Creek Mountains. Notably, one mule deer formerly wintering on the Trout Creek Mountains migrated south from a summer range on the Nevada border to the Montana Mountains during the second documented winter before returning to Oregon in spring. Habitat on winter ranges consists of A. t. wyomingensis (Wyoming big sagebrush) plant communities and non-native annual grasslands. Summer ranges consist mainly of native grasslands, mountain big sagebrush plant communities, and mountain shrub communities. 
The Trout Creek mule deer herd faces several threats, including summer wildfires, highway barriers, and competition for resources. In 2012, the Holloway fire burned 462,017 acres (186,972 ha) including most of the Trout Creek and Oregon Canyon Mountains, resulting in the temporary loss of shrub cover at higher elevations and conversion of native forbs and shrubland to invasive annual grasses at lower elevations. Although no migratory mule deer attempt to cross U.S. Highway 95, some resident mule deer have ranges spanning the busy highway, which had an AADT value of 2,095 vehicles in 2018. The Trout Creek mule deer herd also borders the Barren Creek Complex HMA to the north and the Beaty Butte HMA to the east (DOI and BLM, 2020; BLM 2022). The Barren Creek Complex HMA contains approximately 2,500 feral horses while the Beaty Butte HMA contains 463 horses. Both feral horse populations surpass the respective maximum appropriate management levels of 892 and 250 horses, respectively, suggesting that mule deer and horses compete for resources in the few areas where ranges overlap.
These mapping layers show the location of the migration corridors for mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus) in the Trout Creek population in Oregon. They were developed from 40 migration sequences collected from a sample size of 10 animals comprising GPS locations collected every 5 hours."
Oregon Mule Deer South Wallowas Migration Corridors - Catalog,https://catalog.data.gov//dataset/oregon-mule-deer-south-wallowas-migration-corridors,"South Wallowas mule deer winter ranges are dispersed across areas of low elevation near the Idaho border. During spring, mule deer wintering north of Powder River and Pyles Canyon migrate to Catherine Creek and the Wallowa Mountains within the Wallowa-Whitman National Forest. Interstate 84 creates a complete barrier to southern movement for the South Wallowas herd. Mule deer wintering in areas near Interstate 84, Lawrence Creek, and Manning Creek are largely residents with only two migratory mule deer traveling to Little Lookout Mountain and Thief Valley Reservoir. Other mule deer reside along Snake River, which forms the Idaho border. One mule deer crosses Snake River south of the Powder River headwaters, migrating 24.46 mi (39.36 km) to Weiser River north of Cambridge, Idaho. Their winter range primarily consists of sagebrush communities and Columbia Basin grassland, while summer ranges contain big sagebrush with spruce, quaking aspen, and mixed-conifer forests. Mule deer tend to avoid the lowest elevation areas near Lower Powder Valley and Richland and Durkee, Oregon, instead preferring to winter at an average elevation of 3,435 ft (1,047 m), with average summer range elevations of 5,185 ft (1,580 m). The South Wallowas herd transverses the Keating WMU, which was included in the 2015 Oregon Mule Deer Initiative (ODFW, 2020). Since then, ODFW has removed 159 acres (64 ha) of western juniper, reseeded 203 acres (82 ha) for native shrubs and grasses, and thinned 265 acres (107 ha) of timber stands. The impact these habitat improvements had on population number was reduced when in 2017, January snow depth exceeded 30 in (76 cm) in mule deer winter ranges and average overwinter fawn survival dropped to 24 percent, although fawn survival has since returned to 77 percent in 2018–2021 (ODFW, 2021).
These mapping layers show the location of the migration corridors for mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus) in the South Wallowas population in Oregon. They were developed from 64 migration sequences collected from a sample size of 27 animals comprising GPS locations collected every 5−13 hours."

California Pronghorn Lassen Winter Range - Catalog,https://catalog.data.gov//dataset/california-pronghorn-lassen-winter-range,"The Lassen herd winters in lower elevations in the Secret Valley, Bull Flat, and the Five Springs Wilderness Study Area north of the Skedaddle Mountains and east of Shaffer Mountain, as well as in the Dry Valley Rim Wilderness Study Area. Summer ranges are spread out, with some individuals migrating north to the Madeline Plains and others heading west to Willow Creek Valley, Grasshopper Valley, and Eagle Lake (fig. XXX). An unknown portion of the herd are better characterized as residents. The primary threat to pronghorn in the Lassen herd is the conversion of perennial shrublands to exotic annual grasslands following wildfires. The 2012 Rush Fire burned 271,911 acres in Lassen County within the boundary of the Lassen herd, expanding invasive annual grasslands with altered fire regimes which increase fire frequency and promote the further expansion of exotic grasses. Overabundant free-roaming equids, feral horses and burros, regularly exceed the appropriate management level of the Twin Peaks Herd Management Area, thereby reducing forage and water available for pronghorn. The expansion of juniper into the shrub steppe limits the amount of forage available for pronghorn while increasing the risk of mountain lion predation. The population has been stable to slightly increasing since the 1992-1993 winter die off in northeast California, averaging 974 animals counted during aerial winter surveys (B. Ehler, California Department of Fish and Wildlife, written commun., 2023). CDFW is planning to mark 35 pronghorn with GPS collars in winter 2024 to estimate the population using mark resight surveys.

The 20 future climate scenarios consist of ten GCMs with RCP 4.5 and 8.5 each: ACCESS 1.0, CanESM2, CCSM4, CESM1-BGC, CMCC-CMS, CNRM-CM5, GFDL-CM3, HadGEM2-CC, HadGEM2-ES, and MIROC5. The LOCA climate scenarios span water years 1950 to 2099 with greenhouse-gas forcings beginning in 2006. The LOCA downscaling method has been shown to produce better estimates of extreme events and reduces the common downscaling problem of too many low-precipitation days (Pierce et al., 2014). Ten GCMs were selected from the full ensemble of models from the fifth Coupled Model Intercomparison Project from the World Climate Research Programme (CMIP5) based on GCM historical performance to address specific needs for California water-resource planning (California Department of Water Resources Climate Change Technical Advisory Group, 2015). The 10 GCMs with RCP 4.5 and 8.5 each were statistically downscaled using the LOCA method (Pierce et al., 2014) from 2-degree (approximately 222-kilometer; km) quadrangles to 6-km resolution. Next, the scenarios were spatially downscaled from 6 km to 270 meters (Flint and Flint, 2012) and run through the BCMv8 using the same model parameters and input files as the historical BCM model (BCMv8; Flint et al., 2021).
Downscaled gridded climate variables include precipitation (ppt), minimum temperature (tmn), maximum temperature (tmx), and potential evapotranspiration (pet). Gridded hydrologic variables include actual evapotranspiration (aet), climatic water deficit (cwd), snowpack (pck), recharge (rch), runoff (run), and soil storage (str). The units for temperature variables are degrees Celsius, and all other variables are in millimeters per month. Monthly variables from water years 1951 to 2099 are summarized into water year files (for example, water year 1951 includes October 1950 - September 1951) and 30-year average summaries from 1951 to 2099. Raster grids are in the NAD83 California Teale Albers, (meters) projection in an open format ascii text file (*.asc). 
This data release includes a child item for each GCM. Each GCM child item contains two RCP (4.5 & 8.5) child items. Each RCP child item contains 4 child items:

EVH is produced separately for tree, shrub, and herbaceous lifeforms using training data depicting the weighted average height by species cover and Existing Vegetation Type (EVT) lifeform. Decision tree models using field reference data, lidar, and Landsat are developed separately for each lifeform, then lifeform specific height class layers are merged along with land cover into a single EVH product based on the dominant lifeform of each pixel. EVH ranges are continuous for the herbaceous lifeform category ranging from 0.1 to 1 meter with decimeter increments, 0.1 to 3 meters for shrub lifeform, and 1 to 99 meters for tree lifeform. If the height values of each lifeform exceed the continuous value range, they are binned into the appropriate maximum height class. EVH is then reconciled through QA/QC measures to ensure lifeform is synchronized with Existing Vegetation Cover (EVC). Urban and developed areas are derived from the National Land Cover Database (NLCD), and the latest available Microsoft Building Footprint dataset. Agricultural lands originate from the 2022 Cropland Data Layer (CDL) and the 2019 California Statewide Crop Mapping layer.

"Strontium isotope, amino acid, and fossil taxonomy data to aid in identifying instances of marine terrace reoccupation on Anacapa and San Miguel Islands, California, USA - Catalog",https://catalog.data.gov//dataset/strontium-isotope-amino-acid-and-fossil-taxonomy-data-to-aid-in-identifying-instances-of-m,"In areas of low uplift rate on the Pacific Coast of North America, reoccupation of emergent marine terraces by later high-sea stands has been hypothesized to explain the existence of thermally anomalous faunas (mixtures of warm and cool species) of last interglacial age.  If uplift rates have been low for much of the Quaternary, it follows that higher (older) terraces should also show evidence of reoccupation.  Strontium isotope analyses of fossils from a high-elevation marine terrace on Anacapa Island, California yield a suite of ages ranging from ~2.4-2.3 Ma to ~1.4-1.5 Ma.  These results indicate that terrace reoccupation and fossil mixing on Anacapa Island could have taken place over several interglacial periods in the early Pleistocene.  Terrace reoccupation over this time period is likely a function of both a low uplift rate and the timing of orbital forcing of glacial-interglacial cycles.  Nearby San Miguel Island also has evidence of terrace reoccupation, with Sr-isotope ages of shells from several high-elevation terraces ranging from ~1.21-1.25 Ma to ~0.43-0.50 Ma. However, the frequency of terrace reoccupation was much lower than on Anacapa Island.  The uplift rate of San Miguel Island is higher than that of Anacapa Island and the terraces formed when glacial-interglacial cycles were longer.  The frequency of terrace reoccupation is controlled by the rate of tectonic uplift and the timing of orbital forcing of sea level change during glacial-interglacial cycles."
LANDFIRE 2022 Vegetation Departure (VDep) HI - Catalog,https://catalog.data.gov//dataset/landfire-2022-vegetation-departure-vdep-hi,"LANDFIRE’s (LF) 2022 Vegetation Departure (VDep) product categorizes departure between current vegetation condition and reference vegetation condition, according to the methods outlined in the Interagency Fire Regime Condition Class Guidebook (FRCC Guidebook (Hann et al 2010)). VDep differs from the FRCC Guidebook, however, because it is based on the departure of current vegetation condition only, whereas the FRCC Guidebook approach includes departure of current fire regimes for the reference period. For VDep, summary units are defined as a BioPhysical Setting (BpS) with identical reference condition values regardless of map zone. For example, when a BpS is present in map zone 1, 2, 4, 5, 6 and 8, the reference conditions for this BpS are identical in map zones 1, 2, 4, 5, and 8, those map zones become a summary unit for VDep computation. Since reference conditions are unique for this BpS in map zone 6, it is a separate summary unit for calculating VDep. Within each BpS summary unit, we compare the reference percentage of each Succession Class (SClass) to the current percentage, then the smaller of the two is summed to determine the similarity index for the BpS. This value is then subtracted from 100 to determine the departure value, VDep value is always between 0 and 100, with 100 representing maximum departure. 
Reference conditions are derived from quantitative vegetation dynamics models that mimic native, pre-European colonization disturbance regimes. The current conditions are derived from the corresponding LF 2022 SClass data for each BpS. The proportion of the landscape occupied by each SClass, in each BpS unit, within each summary unit represents current condition of that SClass in VDep calculation. VDep is based entirely on the remaining area of each BpS unit that is occupied by valid SClasses. Each pixel in a BpS within a summary unit has the same VDep value."

LANDFIRE 2022 Fuel Disturbance (FDist) Puerto Rico US Virgin Islands - Catalog,https://catalog.data.gov//dataset/landfire-2022-fuel-disturbance-fdist-puerto-rico-us-virgin-islands,"LANDFIRE (LF) disturbance products are developed to provide temporal and spatial information related to landscape change. LF 2022 Fuel Disturbance (FDist) uses the latest Annual Disturbance products from the effective disturbance years of 2013 to 2022. FDist is created from LF 2022 Historical Disturbance (HDist) which in turn aggregates the Annual Disturbance products. FDist groups similar disturbance types, severities and time since disturbance categories which represent disturbance scenarios within the fuel environment. FDist is used in conjunction with Fuel Vegetation Type (FVT), Cover (FVC), and Height (FVH) to calculate Canopy Cover (CC), Canopy Height (CH), Canopy Bulk Density (CBD), Canopy Base Height (CBH), Fire Behavior Fuel Models 13 Anderson (FBFM13) and 40 Scott and Burgan (FBFM40). 
FDist is developed using the aggregated Annual Disturbance products from 2013 to 2022. All existing disturbances between 2013-2022 are represented in the LF 2022 update, and the products are intended to be used in 2023 (the year of release). The “capable” year terminology used in LF 2020 and LF 2016 Remap is no longer specified, due to reduction in latency from when a disturbance occurs to the release date of fuel products accounting for that disturbance. However, users should still consider adjusting fuel layers for disturbances that occurred after the end of the 2022 fiscal year (after October 1st, 2022) when using the LF 2022 fuel products.

Specific conductance data collected during slug additions - Catalog,https://catalog.data.gov//dataset/specific-conductance-data-collected-during-slug-additions,"Slug additions are often the most accurate method for determining discharge when traditional current meter or acoustic measurements are unreliable because of high turbulence, rocky streambed, shallow or sheet flow, or the stream is physically inaccessible (e.g., under ice or canyon walls) or unsafe to wade (Zellweger et al., 1989, Kilpatrick and Cobb 1984, Ferranti 2015).  The slug addition method for determining discharge requires an injection of a known amount of a single salt and high-frequency downstream measurement of solute concentration to capture the response curve (Kilpatrick and Cobb 1984). A new slug method was developed to determine stream discharge utilizing specific conductance and ionic molal conductivities to quantify the downstream salt concentration. The new method adopts an approach that accurately calculates the specific conductance of natural waters (McCleskey, et al., 2012). The main advantage of the new method is high-frequency measurements of specific conductance are easily obtained and the method does not require collection or analyses of discrete samples, allowing for more rapid and less expensive measurements. Data from twenty-nine slug additions are presented. The data were used to evaluate the performance of the new discharge method by comparing with discharge estimates obtained by other means (Manning et al. 2022; McCleskey et al., 2021; U.S. Geological Survey, 2022).

CBH data are continuous from 0 to 9.9 meters (to the nearest 0.1m) and describe the lowest point in a stand where there is enough available fuel (0.25in diameter) to propagate fire vertically through the canopy. Critical CBH is defined as the lowest point at which the Canopy Bulk Density (CBD) is .012kg m-3. Under different scenarios of disturbance and based on previous research incorporating plot-level CBH calculations, CBH for disturbed areas is determined via a set of linear equations relating Canopy Height (CH) and Canopy Cover (CC) to CBH. Linear equations for these calculations are derived from Forest Vegetation Simulator (FVS) scenario outputs.

EVH is produced separately for tree, shrub, and herbaceous lifeforms using training data depicting the weighted average height by species cover and Existing Vegetation Type (EVT) lifeform. Decision tree models using field reference data, lidar, and Landsat are developed separately for each lifeform, then lifeform specific height class layers are merged along with land cover into a single EVH product based on the dominant lifeform of each pixel. EVH ranges are continuous for the herbaceous lifeform category ranging from 0.1 to 1 meter with decimeter increments, 0.1 to 3 meters for shrub lifeform, and 1 to 99 meters for tree lifeform. If the height values of each lifeform exceed the continuous value range, they are binned into the appropriate maximum height class. EVH is then reconciled through QA/QC measures to ensure lifeform is synchronized with Existing Vegetation Cover (EVC). Urban and developed areas are derived from the National Land Cover Database (NLCD), and the latest available Microsoft Building Footprint dataset. Agricultural lands originate from the 2022 Cropland Data Layer (CDL) and the 2019 California Statewide Crop Mapping layer. Disturbance events after 2016 are accounted for by incorporating transition rulesets using LF 2022 Fuel Disturbance (FDist). LF uses EVH as an input for LF 2022 Fuel Vegetation Height (FVH)."

The LOCA climate scenarios span water years 1950 to 2099 with greenhouse-gas forcings beginning in 2006. The LOCA downscaling method has been shown to produce better estimates of extreme events and reduces the common downscaling problem of too many low-precipitation days (Pierce et al., 2014). Ten GCMs were selected from the full ensemble of models from the fifth Coupled Model Intercomparison Project from the World Climate Research Programme (CMIP5) based on GCM historical performance to address specific needs for California water-resource planning (California Department of Water Resources Climate Change Technical Advisory Group, 2015). The 10 GCMs with RCP 4.5 and 8.5 each were statistically downscaled using the LOCA method (Pierce et al., 2014) from 2-degree (approximately 222-kilometer; km) quadrangles to 6-km resolution. Next, the scenarios were spatially downscaled from 6 km to 270 meters (Flint and Flint, 2012) and run through the BCMv8 using the same model parameters and input files as the historical BCM model (BCMv8; Flint et al., 2021).
Downscaled gridded climate variables include precipitation (ppt), minimum temperature (tmn), maximum temperature (tmx), and potential evapotranspiration (pet). Gridded hydrologic variables include: actual evapotranspiration (aet), climatic water deficit (cwd), snowpack (pck), recharge (rch), runoff (run), and soil storage (str). The units for temperature variables are degrees Celsius, and all other variables are in millimeters per month. Monthly variables from water years 1951 to 2099 are summarized into water year files (for example, water year 1951 includes October 1950 - September 1951) and 30-year average summaries from 1951 to 2099.

The 2016 release saw landcover created for additional years of 2003, 2008, and 2013. These products provide spatially explicit and reliable information on the Nation’s land cover and land cover change. To continue the legacy of NLCD and further establish a long-term monitoring capability for the Nation’s land resources, the USGS has designed a new generation of NLCD products named NLCD 2019. The NLCD 2019 design aims to provide innovative, consistent, and robust methodologies for production of a multi-temporal land cover and land cover change database from 2001 to 2019 at 2–3-year intervals. Comprehensive research was conducted and resulted in developed strategies for NLCD 2019: continued integration between impervious surface and all landcover products with impervious surface being directly mapped as developed classes in the landcover, a streamlined compositing process for assembling and preprocessing based on Landsat imagery and geospatial ancillary datasets; a multi-source integrated training data development and decision-tree based land cover classifications; a temporally, spectrally, and spatially integrated land cover change analysis strategy; a hierarchical theme-based post-classification and integration protocol for generating land cover and change products; a continuous fields biophysical parameters modeling method; and an automated scripted operational system for the NLCD 2019 production. The performance of the developed strategies and methods were tested in twenty composite referenced areas throughout the conterminous U.S. An overall accuracy assessment from the 2016 publication give a 91% overall landcover accuracy, with the developed classes also showing a 91% accuracy in overall developed.  Results from this study confirm the robustness of this comprehensive and highly automated procedure for NLCD 2019 operational mapping. Questions about the NLCD 2019 land cover product can be directed to the NLCD 2019 land cover mapping team at USGS EROS, Sioux Falls, SD (605) 594-6151 or mrlc@usgs.gov.

Green River Oil Shale Resources Database - Catalog,https://catalog.data.gov//dataset/green-river-oil-shale-resources-database,"The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) recently completed a comprehensive assessment of in-place oil in oil shales in the Eocene Green River in the Greater Green River Basin, Wyoming, Colorado, and Utah. A database was compiled that includes about 47,000 Fischer assays from 186 core holes and 240 rotary drill holes. Most of the oil yield data were analyzed by the former U.S. Bureau of Mines oil shale laboratory in Laramie, Wyoming, and some analyses were made by private laboratories. Total in-place resources for the three assessed units in the Green River Formation are: (1) Tipton Shale Member, 362,816 million barrels of oil (MMBO), (2) Wilkins Peak Member, 704,991 MMBO, and (3) LaClede Bed of the Laney Member, 377,184 MMBO, for a total of 1.44 trillion barrels of oil in place. This compares with estimated in-place resources for the Piceance Basin of Colorado of 1.53 trillion barrels and estimated in-place resources for the Uinta Basin of Utah and Colorado of 1.32 trillion barrels.

Data from: Vegetation index-based partitioning of evapotranspiration is deficient in grazed systems - Catalog,https://catalog.data.gov//dataset/data-from-vegetation-index-based-partitioning-of-evapotranspiration-is-deficient-in-grazed-98cf1,"The dataset includes 30 minutes values of partitioned evaporation (E) and transpiration (T), T:ET ratios, and other ancillary datasets for three ET partitioning methods viz. Flux Variance Similarity (FVS) method, Transpiration Estimation Algorithm (TEA), and Underlying Water Use Efficiency (uWUE) method for three wheat sites. Three wheat sites had different grazing treatments. For example, Site 1 was Grain-only and Graze-grain wheat for the 2016-17 and 2017-18 growing seasons, respectively. Site 2 was Grain-only wheat for the 2017-18 growing season. Site 3 was Graze-grain and Graze-out wheat for the 2016-17 and 2017-18 growing seasons, respectively.
The grain-only wheat system is a single purpose to produce wheat grains only. Graze-grain wheat system has a dual purpose as it serves as a pasture for grazing cattle from November to February and is used to produce wheat grains later. Graze-out wheat system is also a single purpose crop that is grazed by the cattle for the entire season to solely serve as a pasture.
FVS method performed ET partitioning using the high frequency (10 Hz) data collected from Eddy Covariance Flux stations, located near the middle of each field. The high-frequency data were also processed using the EddyPro software to get good quality estimates of different fluxes at 30-minute intervals. The processed 30-min data were used by TEA and uWUE methods for ET partitioning. Ancillary hydro-meteorological variables including net radiation, air temperature, soil water content, relative humidity, and others, also have been included in this dataset.

One way to address this surveillance deficiency is to utilize established infrastructure, such as zoological parks, to investigate animal disease outbreaks and improve our epidemiological understanding of vector-borne pathogens. During fall 2020, an outbreak of epizootic hemorrhagic disease (EHD) at the Minnesota Zoo resulted in morbidity and seroconversion of several collection animals. In response to this outbreak, insect surveillance was conducted, and the collected insects were tested for the presence of epizootic hemorrhagic disease virus (EHDV) by RT-qPCR to better understand the local transmitting vector populations responsible for the outbreak. Six pools of Culicoides biting midges were positive for EHDV, including three pools of Culicoides sonorensis, two pools of Culicoides variipennis, and a pool of degraded C. variipennis complex midges. All three endemic serotypes of EHDV (1, 2, and 6) were detected in both animals and midge pools from the premises. Despite this outbreak, no EHDV cases had been reported in wild animals near the zoo. This highlights the importance and utility of using animal holding facilities, such as zoos, as sentinels to better understand the spatio-temporal dynamics of pathogen transmission."

"Dataset for ""Cover crop inclusion and residue retention improves soybean production and physiology in drought conditions"" - Catalog",https://catalog.data.gov//dataset/dataset-for-cover-crop-inclusion-and-residue-retention-improves-soybean-production-and-phy-7ffad,"Data and code for ""Cover crop inclusion and residue retention improves soybean production and physiology in drought conditions""
CONTEXT: Soybean (Glycine max (L.) Merr.) planting has increased in central and western North Dakota despite frequent drought occurrences that limit productivity.  Soybean plants need high photosynthetic and transpiration rates to be productive, but they also need high water use efficiency when water is limited. Retaining crop residues and including cover crops in crop rotations are management strategies that could improve soybean drought resilience in the northern Great Plains.   
OBJECTIVE: We aimed to examine how a management practice that included cover crops and residue retention impacts agronomic, ecosystem water and carbon dioxide flux, and canopy-scale physiological attributes of soybeans in the northern Great Plains under drought conditions.  
METHODS:  We compared two soybean fields over two years with business-as-usual and aspirational management that included residue retention and cover crops during a drought year.  This comparison was based on yield, aboveground biomass, Phenocam images, and fluxes from eddy covariance and ancillary measurements.  These measurements were used to derive meteorological, physical, and physiological attributes with the ‘big leaf’ framework. 
RESULTS: Soybean yields were 29% higher under drought conditions in the field managed in a system that included cover crops and residue retention. This yield increase was caused by extending the maturity phenophase by 5 days, increasing agronomic and intrinsic water use efficiency by 27% and 33%, respectively, increasing water uptake, and increasing the rubisco-limited photosynthetic capacity (Vcmax25) by 42%.
CONCLUSIONS: The inclusion of cover crops and residue retention into a cropping system improved soybean productivity because of differences in water use, phenology timing, and photosynthetic capacity.
IMPLICATIONS: These results suggest that farmers can improve soybean productivity and yield stability by incorporating cover crops and residue retention into their management practices because these practices allow soybean plants to shift to a more aggressive water uptake strategy.

Soils Data for North Dakota Mined Land Reclamation Experiments in the 1970’s Using Soil Respreading - Catalog,https://catalog.data.gov//dataset/soils-data-for-north-dakota-mined-land-reclamation-experiments-in-the-1970s-using-soil-res-4e231,"In the early 1970’s, it was determined that the most feasible way to reclaim lands disturbed by coal surface mining in the Northern Great Plains region was through the respreading of salvaged soil.  In 1974, scientists at the Northern Great Plains Research Laboratory of the Agricultural Research Service -- U. S. Department of Agriculture (USDA-ARS) initiated two experiments designed to determine the thicknesses of respread soil necessary to restore productivity to difficult-to-reclaim sodic minespoils in central North Dakota (ND).  In both experiments, motorscraper and other earthmoving equipment was used to construct wedge-shaped masses of subsoil materials over leveled minespoils and then to cover these with uniform thicknesses of topsoil material.  Topsoil consisted of predominately A horizon material from Haplustoll soils, and subsoil consisted of B and C horizon material.
In one experiment near the town of Stanton ND, a subsoil wedge was constructed on leveled minespoil and consisted of 12 long contiguous blocks of material (which were the main plots), three replications of four topsoil thickness treatments.  For each replication, three of the main treatment blocks consisted of subsoil material, and one was a 3:1 subsoil – topsoil mix.  The topsoil treatments consisted of no topsoil, 20 cm, 60 cm, and no topsoil on the mixed soil block.  Each main treatment block was split into four long strips and seeded to crops of alfalfa, crested wheatgrass, spring wheat, and warm-season grass mix.  The wedge was 240 m long, 65 m wide, and 2.1 m high at the summit.
In another experiment near the town of Zap ND, a double subsoil wedge was constructed on leveled minespoil and consisted of six long contiguous blocks of material (which were the main plots), two replications on each side of the wedge, for a total of four replications with three subsoil quality treatments.  The subsoils varied in soil texture, salinity and sodicity.  The wedge was covered with a uniform 20 cm thickness of topsoil.  Each main treatment block was split into four long strips and seeded to the same crops as the Stanton site with the exception of warm-season grass mix, which was replaced with Russian wildrye.  The double wedge was 124 m long, and about 50 m from each toe to summit for a total width of 102 m and was 2.1 m high at the summit.

Orchardgrass (Dactylis glomerata L.) could serve as a cool-season perennial in southeastern production systems, but often does not behave as a true perennial under high temperature stress conditions of the region. This work sought to develop heat-tolerant orchardgrass germplasm through recurrent phenotypic selection (RPS) that would both reduce secondary seed dormancy caused by high soil temperatures and improve stand persistence over summer months. Selection was conducted in a growth chamber 40/30 °C (12/12 h, light/darkness), with germinated seedlings subjected to an additional 2–3 weeks of 40/30 °C conditions. The base germplasm (Cycle 0) and selected individuals (Cycles 1–3) were transplanted into the field, then harvested for seed. Forty-degree germination tests compared mean cumulative germination, velocity of germination within 8 days (VOG8), and realized heritability. Stand persistence was assessed 1 year after transplanting.

Turfgrass Soil Carbon Change Through Time: Raw Data and Code - Catalog,https://catalog.data.gov//dataset/turfgrass-soil-carbon-change-through-time-raw-data-and-code-1dd62,"Data Description
Managed turfgrass is a common component of urban landscapes that is expanding under current land use trends. Previous studies have reported high rates of soil carbon sequestration in turfgrass, but no systematic review has summarized these rates nor evaluated how they change as turfgrass ages. We conducted a meta-analysis of soil carbon sequestration rates from 63 studies. Those data, as well as the code used to analyze them and create figures, are shared here.
Dataset Development
We conducted a systematic review from Nov 2020 to Jan 2021 using Google Scholar, Web of Science, and the Michigan Turfgrass Information File Database. The search terms targeted were ""soil carbon"", ""carbon sequestration"", ""carbon storage"", or “carbon stock”, with ""turf"", ""turfgrass"", ""lawn"", ""urban ecosystem"", or ""residential"", “Fescue”, “Zoysia”, “Poa”, “Cynodon”, “Bouteloua”, “Lolium”, or “Agrostis”. We included only peer-reviewed studies written in English that measured SOC change over one year or longer, and where grass was managed as turf (mowed or clipped regularly). We included studies that sampled to any soil depth, and included several methodologies: small-plot research conducted over a few years (22 datasets from 4 articles), chronosequences of golf courses or residential lawns (39 datasets from 16 articles), and one study that was a variation on a chronosequence method and compiled long-term soil test data provided by golf courses of various ages (3 datasets from Qian & Follett, 2002). In total, 63 datasets from 21 articles met the search criteria.
We excluded 1) duplicate reports of the same data, 2) small plot studies that did not report baseline SOC stocks, and 3) pure modeling studies. We included five papers that only measured changes in SOC concentrations, but not areal stocks (i.e., SOC in Mg ha-1). For these papers, we converted from concentrations to stocks using several approaches. For two papers (Law & Patton, 2017; Y. Qian & Follett, 2002) we used estimated bulk densities provided by the authors. For the chronosequences reported in Selhorst & Lal (2011), we used the average bulk density reported by the author. For the 13 choronosequences reported in Selhorst & Lal (2013), we estimated bulk density from the average relationship between percent C and bulk density reported by Selhorst (2011). For Wang et al. (2014), we used bulk density values from official soil survey descriptions.
Data provenance
In most cases we contacted authors of the studies to obtain the original data. If authors did not reply after two inquiries, or no longer had access to the data, we captured data from published figures using WebPlotDigitizer (Rohatgi, 2021). For three manuscripts the data was already available, or partially available, in public data repositories. Data provenance information is provided in the document ""Dataset summaries and citations.docx"".

"Vegetation, rainfall simulation, and overland flow experiments before and after tree removal in woodland-encroached sagebrush steppe: the SageSTEP hydrology study - Catalog",https://catalog.data.gov//dataset/vegetation-rainfall-simulation-and-overland-flow-experiments-before-and-after-tree-removal-35eda,"Simulated rainfall and overland-flow experiments are useful for enhancing understanding of surface hydrologic and erosion processes, quantifying runoff and erosion rates, and developing and testing predictive quantitative models. This extensive dataset (1021 experimental plots) consists of rainfall simulation (1300 plot runs, 0.5 m2 to 13 m2 scales) and overland flow (838 plot runs, ~9 m2 scale) experimental plot data coupled with associated measures of vegetation, ground cover, and surface soil properties across point to hillslope scales. The data were collected at three woodland-encroached sagebrush (Artemisia spp.) rangelands in the Great Basin, USA, under undisturbed/untreated conditions and 1 yr to 9 yr following fire and/or mechanical tree-removal treatments. The methodology employed and resulting experimental data contribute to quantifying and understanding scale-dependent surface hydrologic and erosion processes for Great Basin woodlands and sagebrush rangelands before and after tree removal and for sparsely vegetated sites elsewhere. The dataset is a valuable source for developing and testing hydrology and erosion models for applications to diverse vegetation and ground cover conditions. Lastly, the series of repeated measures in the dataset for some sites over time provides a valuable dataset for exploring long-term landscape vegetation and hydrologic and erosion responses to various land management practices and disturbances.
The resulting collective dataset of 1021 experimental plots contains vegetation, ground cover, soils, hydrology, and erosion data collected across multiple spatial scales, diverse cover and surface conditions, three study sites, and five different study years. The collective dataset contains 57 plots at the hillslope scale (site characterization plots), 528 small-rainfall plots, 146 large-rainfall plots, and 290 overland-flow plots. The hydrology and erosion experiments yielded time series datasets for small-rainfall plot, large-rainfall plot, and overland-flow plot simulations. Some time series hydrographs and sedigraphs from rainfall and overland flow simulations were excluded due to various equipment failures. The final time series datasets consist of 1020 small-rainfall, 280 large-rainfall, and 838 overland-flow plot run hydrographs and sedigraphs, not excluding plots without runoff. Restricting the data to plots that generated runoff results in 749 small-rainfall, 251 large-rainfall, and 719 overland-flow plot simulation hydrographs and sedigraphs. Overall, the hydrology and erosion time series dataset amounts to 2138 hydrographs/sedigraphs including plots with zero runoff and 1719 hydrographs/sedigraphs for plots that generated runoff.
Field experiments and data management were conducted as part of the Sagebrush Steppe Treatment Evaluation Project (SageSTEP, (www.sagestep.org) funded by the US Joint Fire Science Program, US Department of Interior (USDI) Bureau of Land Management, and US National Interagency Fire Center.

Soil samples were collected in Fall of 2017 from the riparian oak forest located at the Russell Ranch Sustainable Agricultural Institute at the University of California Davis. The soil was sieved through a 2 mm mesh and was air dried before imaging. A single soil aggregate was scanned at 23 keV using the 10x objective lens with a pixel resolution of 650 nanometers on beamline 8.3.2 at the ALS.
Additionally, a drought stressed almond flower bud (Prunus dulcis) from a plant housed at the University of California, Davis, was scanned using a 4x lens with a pixel resolution of 1.72 µm on beamline 8.3.2 at the ALS
Raw tomographic image data was reconstructed using TomoPy. Reconstructions were converted to 8-bit tif or png format using ImageJ or the PIL package in Python before further processing.  Images were annotated using Intel’s Computer Vision Annotation Tool (CVAT) and ImageJ. Both CVAT and ImageJ are free to use and open source. Leaf images were annotated in following Théroux-Rancourt et al. (2020). Specifically, Hand labeling was done directly in ImageJ by drawing around each tissue; with 5 images annotated per leaf.  Care was taken to cover a range of anatomical variation to help improve the generalizability of the models to other leaves. All slices were labeled by Dr. Mina Momayyezi and Fiona Duong.To annotate the flower bud and soil aggregate, images were imported into CVAT. The exterior border of the bud (i.e. bud scales) and flower were annotated in CVAT and exported as masks. Similarly, the exterior of the soil aggregate and particulate organic matter identified by eye were annotated in CVAT and exported as masks. To annotate air spaces in both the bud and soil aggregate, images were imported into ImageJ. A gaussian blur was applied to the image to decrease noise and then the air space was segmented using thresholding. After applying the threshold, the selected air space region was converted to a binary image with white representing the air space and black representing everything else. This binary image was overlaid upon the original image and the air space within the flower bud and aggregate was selected using the “free hand” tool. Air space outside of the region of interest for both image sets was eliminated. The quality of the air space annotation was then visually inspected for accuracy against the underlying original image; incomplete annotations were corrected using the brush or pencil tool to paint missing air space white and incorrectly identified air space black. Once the annotation was satisfactorily corrected, the binary image of the air space was saved. Finally, the annotations of the bud and flower or aggregate and organic matter were opened in ImageJ and the associated air space mask was overlaid on top of them forming a three-layer mask suitable for training the fully convolutional network. All labeling of the soil aggregate and soil aggregate images was done by Dr. Devin Rippner.
These images and annotations are for training deep learning models to identify different constituents in leaves, almond buds, and soil aggregates
Limitations:
For the walnut leaves, some tissues (stomata, etc.) are not labeled and only represent a small portion of a full leaf. Similarly, both the almond bud and the aggregate represent just one single sample of each. The bud tissues are only divided up into buds scales, flower, and air space. Many other tissues remain unlabeled. For the soil aggregate annotated labels are done by eye with no actual chemical information. Therefore particulate organic matter identification may be incorrect.

Data from: Grazing Effects on Nitrous Oxide Flux in an Integrated Crop-Livestock System - Catalog,https://catalog.data.gov//dataset/data-from-grazing-effects-on-nitrous-oxide-flux-in-an-integrated-crop-livestock-system-3ef55,"Integrated crop-livestock (ICL) systems represent a promising approach to sustainably intensify agricultural production. However, the inherent complexity of ICL systems contributes to potential tradeoffs among production, economic, and environmental attributes. Among the many important environmental metrics associated with agricultural production, nitrous oxide (N2O) flux from soil is prominent for its dual role as a strong greenhouse gas and its capacity to deplete ozone in the stratosphere. Unfortunately, there is limited understanding of ICL system effects on N2O flux from soil, especially in North America. Given this context, soil-atmosphere N2O flux was measured from ICL and non-ICL practices over a 3-year period near Mandan, ND USA. Evaluated treatments included grazed and ungrazed cropland and grassland, each replicated four times. Measurements of N2O flux were made using static chamber methodology 93 times over the study period (14 Oct 2016 – 16 Oct 2019). Near-surface soil water content and temperature were measured concurrently with N2O flux when the soil was not frozen. Seasonal measurements of soil bulk density, soil pH, and extractable nitrate-N and ammonium-N were evaluated in all treatments each year. Data may be used to understand N2O flux and soil property dynamics in ICL production systems. Data are generally applicable to cropland under a semiarid Continental climate for the following soil types: Grassna, Linton, Mandan, Temvik, Williams, and Wilton."
Data from: Identification of robust yield QTL derived from cultivated emmer for durum wheat improvement - Catalog,https://catalog.data.gov//dataset/data-from-identification-of-robust-yield-qtl-derived-from-cultivated-emmer-for-durum-wheat-64b14,"Phenotypic Data
Two durum × cultivated emmer recombinant inbred line (RIL) populations were evaluated for grain yield components under field conditions in North Dakota, USA. The BP025 population was developed by crossing Ben (PI 596557), a North Dakota hard amber durum variety, with PI 41025, a cultivated emmer accession collected near Samara, Russia. The BP025 population consists of 200 RILs developed by single seed-descent and was advanced to the F7:8 generation. The RP883 population was developed by crossing the durum line Rusty (PI 639869) with PI 193883, a cultivated emmer wheat accession collected near Shewa, Ethiopia. The RP883 population consists of 190 RILs developed by single seed-descent and was advanced to the F7:8 generation.
The two populations were evaluated under field conditions in a total of three seasons for each and were grown in a randomized complete block design (RCBD) with three replicates per season. Plants were grown in hill plots with each plot consisting of 10-15 seeds and considered an experimental unit. The BP025 population was planted and evaluated in 2017, 2018, and 2019. The RP883 population was evaluated in 2018, 2019, and 2020. The 2017, 2018, and 2019 plots were grown at the North Dakota State University field site near Prosper, ND (47.002°N, 97.115°W), and the 2020 plots were grown at the NDSU agronomy seed farm near Casselton, ND (46.880°N, 97.243°W). The BP025 and RP883 populations and parental lines were evaluated for 11 traits including days to heading (DTH), plant height (PHT), the total number of spikelets per spike (SPS), kernels per spike (KPS), grain weight per spike (GWS), thousand kernel weight (TKW), kernel area (KA), kernel width (KW), kernel length (KL), kernel circularity (KC), and kernel length:width ratio (KLW). DTH was measured as the number of days from planting until 50 % of the spikes emerged completely beyond the flag leaf. PHT was measured in centimeters from the base of the plot to the tip of the tallest spike (excluding awns). Eight heads were used for phenotypic evaluations. SPS was counted as the total number of spikelets per spike. KPS, GWS, TKW, KA, KW, KL, KC, and KLW were obtained using a MARVIN grain analyzer (GAT Sensorik GMBH, Neubrandenburg, Germany). For KPS and GWS, the value obtained by the MARVIN for each sample was divided by the number of spikes in that sample to obtain KPS and GWS for data analysis.

Data from: Identifying Critical Life Stage Transitions for Biological Control of Long-lived Perennial Vincetoxicum Species - Catalog,https://catalog.data.gov//dataset/data-from-identifying-critical-life-stage-transitions-for-biological-control-of-long-lived-41b5d,"This dataset includes data on 25 transitions of a matrix demographic model of the invasive species Vincetoxicum nigrum (L.) Moench (black swallow-wort or black dog-strangling vine) and Vincetoxicum rossicum (Kleopow) Barb. (pale swallow-wort or dog-strangling vine) (Apocynaceae, subfamily Asclepiadoideae), two invasive perennial vines in the northeastern U.S.A. and southeastern Canada. The matrix model was developed for projecting population growth rates as a result of changes to lower-level vital rates from biological control although the model is generalizable to any control tactic. Transitions occurred among the five life stages of seeds, seedlings, vegetative juveniles (defined as being in at least their second season of growth), small flowering plants (having 1–2 stems), and large flowering plants (having 3 or more stems). Transition values were calculated using deterministic equations and data from 20 lower-level vital rates collected from 2009-2012 from two open field and two forest understory populations of V. rossicum (43°51’N, 76°17’W; 42°48'N, 76°40'W) and two open field populations of V. nigrum (41°46’N, 73°44’W; 41°18’N, 73°58’W) in New York State. Sites varied in plant densities, soil depth, and light levels (forest populations). Detailed descriptions of vital rate data collection may be found in: Milbrath et al. 2017. Northeastern Naturalist 24(1):37-53. Five replicate sets of transition data obtained from five separate spatial regions of a particular infestation were produced for each of the six populations.

Metadata is contained within excel file that describes all variables for each tab.
Abstract from paper:
The use of artificial clay caterpillars to measure predation pressure under real field conditions is one method that has garnered recent support for quantifying ecosystem services that beneficial insects provide. Here, we focus on color and ask whether it is an important variable that should be considered in studies using clay caterpillars as sentinel prey. We deployed a total of 1920 brown, cream, green, gray, terracotta, and white clay caterpillars onto maize, soybean, and prairie plants to test if lighter colored caterpillars will be attacked and retrieved more than caterpillars with darker colors. As hypothesized, color was a significant predictor with green and terracotta caterpillars performing best, whereas brown and gray caterpillars performed the worst. Interestingly, clay caterpillars were also attacked proportionally to the number of insects in the surrounding habitat. Combined, we suggest artificial clay caterpillars could be useful for rapid ecosystem function assessments, but only when their color is considered. Resources in this "
Data from: Identification of stable QTL controlling multiple yield components in a durum × cultivated emmer wheat population under field and greenhouse conditions - Catalog,https://catalog.data.gov//dataset/data-from-identification-of-stable-qtl-controlling-multiple-yield-components-in-a-durum-cu-17797,"Phentoypic data: The durum × cultivated emmer recombinant inbred line (RIL) population (referred to as DP527) was evaluated for grain yield components under greenhouse and field conditions in North Dakota, USA. The DP527 population was developed by crossing Divide (PI 642021), a North Dakota hard amber durum variety, with PI 272527, a cultivated emmer accession collected near Pest, Hungary. The DP527 population consisted of 219 RILs developed using the single-seed descent method to the F7 generation and bulked to produce F7:8 RILs. The DP527 population was evaluated under field conditions in a total of three seasons and were grown in a randomized complete block design (RCBD) with three replicates each season. Plants were grown in hill plots, with each plot consisting of 10-15 seeds and considered an experimental unit. The 2017 and 2019 plots were grown at the North Dakota State University (NDSU) field site near Prosper, ND (47.002°N, 97.115°W). The 2020 plots were grown at the NDSU agronomy seed farm near Casselton, ND (46.880°N, 97.243°W). The DP527 population and parental lines were phenotyped for 11 traits including days to heading (DTH), plant height (PHT), total number of spikelets per spike (SPS), kernels per spike (KPS), grain weight per spike (GWS), thousand kernel weight (TKW), kernel area (KA), kernel width (KW), kernel length (KL), kernel circularity (KC), and kernel length:width ratio (KLW). DTH was measured as the number of days from planting until 50% of the spikes emerged completely beyond the flag leaf. PHT was measured from the base of the hill plot to the tip of the highest spike (excluding awns) in the plot in centimeters. Eight heads from each replicate were used for phenotypic evaluations. SPS was counted as the total number of spikelets divided by the number of heads in the sample. KPS, GWS, TKW, KA, KW, KL, KC, and KLW data were obtained using a MARVIN grain analyzer (GAT Sensorik GMBH, Neubrandenburg, Germany). KPS and GWS data from the MARVIN was divided by the number of heads in the sample to obtain an average per wheat head. For the 2019 environment, planting occurred in late May, and by early September about one third of the lines were not mature. Therefore, only DTH, PHT, and SPS were evaluated in the 2019 field season. The DP527 population and parents were evaluated under greenhouse conditions in two greenhouse seasons (2018 and 2019) with two replicates per season. Plants were grown in 15 cm diameter pots in a greenhouse with 16-h photoperiod and a temperature of 21 °C. All plants were grown in a completely randomized design (CRD) with one plant per pot, which was one experimental unit. DTH was measured as the number of days from planting until the emergence of the first spike beyond the flag leaf, and PHT was measured from the base of the plant to the tip of the highest spike in centimeters. Plants were hand harvested and four heads per plant were used for the rest of the phenotypic evaluations, which were measured as described for field environments. In the data file, column headings indicate the trait evaluated, the year, field vs greenhouse, and replicate or average of all three replicates. For example, “SPS2017Frep1” indicates rep 1 of the spikelets per spike trait collected in the 2017 field trial. Sheet 1 consists of the field data, and sheet 2 is the greenhouse data. An entry of ‘NA’ indicates missing data.
Genotypic data: DNA of the DP527 population was extracted and genotyped using the Illumina iSelect 90k wheat SNP array. The genotypic data file consists of the chromosome assignments of the markers, the marker names, the linkage map positions of the markers, and the genotypic calls for each marker within each RIL where “1” represents an allele from Divide, “2” represents an allele from PI 272527, and “3” indicates missing data. This data was used to assemble the linkage-based genetic maps for the 14 durum wheat chromosomes and further used in statistical analyses to identify chromosome regions harboring genes associated with the various phenotypic traits mentioned in the phenotypic data file.

Data from: Field Trapping and Flight Capacity of Eucosma giganteana (Riley) (Lepidoptera: Tortricidae) in Response to Behaviorally Active Congeneric Semiochemicals in Novel Silflower Agroecosystems - Catalog,https://catalog.data.gov//dataset/data-from-field-trapping-and-flight-capacity-of-eucosma-giganteana-riley-lepidoptera-tortr-ac4ac,"We evaluated the flight behavior of E. giganteana in response to semiochemicals identified from other closely related Eucosma species, including: (Z)- and (E)-8-dodecenyl acetate, (E)-9-dodecenyl acetate, (Z)-8-dodecenol, (E,E)-8,10-dodecadienyl acetate, and (Z,E)-9,12-tetradecadienyl acetate. The goals of this study were to evaluate whether any of these compounds could improve capture of E. giganteana on clear sticky cards in the field, and whether the most attractive volatiles might affect flight behavior on a computer-automated flight mill assay. We found that there was significant attraction to (E)-8-dodecenyl acetate in two years in the field, which may possibly be a component in the pheromone blend for E. giganteana. On flight mills, E. giganteana flew an average of 23 km in a 24 h period. The presence of attractive stimuli (e.g., (E)-8-dodecenyl acetate) had arresting properties and decreasing flight distance on the mill by 78 to 80%. The longest flight distances were registered in the morning (4:00–12:00) and were 1.8-fold greater than flight distances and durations at night (20:00–4:00). (E)-8-dodecenyl acetate may be useful in behaviorally based monitoring and management strategies for E. giganteana. Overall, our research expands the knowledge on the chemical ecology of adult E. giganteana.
Dataset includes testing field-captured E. giganteana adults collected from UV light traps deployed at The Land Institute in Salina, KS, and hand-collected at night during the period of peak activity for E. giganteana. Two trials are included: a field baiting assay, and laboratory flight mill assay. In the field baiting assay, each field had three transects spaced at least 10 m apart, each with a full set of semiochemical treatments represented. Each trap within the transect was spaced 10 m apart. Each trap consisted of a 1.27-cm diameter PVC pipe hammered in row with the silflower to a finished height of 1 m, in line with the canopy of Silphium integrifolium. A single 30.4 cm × 30.4 cm clear sticky card (Alpha Scents, Canby, OR, USA) was folded in half and inserted in a 271 cm long sticky card ring holder (Olson Products Inc., Medina, OH, USA). The ring holder was bent at a 90° angle to wedge the card holder upright in position, which was subsequently wedged in the opening at the top of the PVC pipe. A single, capped LDPE 3-mL dropping bottle with one of the semiochemical treatments above was inserted in the top of the PCV pipe opening and affixed in place by tying it to the card holder with garden wire. Every week, the lures were replaced with a freshly prepared treatment and the position of the lure was rotated in the transect every two weeks. Traps were rotated because of the short duration of the flying season and resulted in every treatment occupying every position at least once. Sticky cards were changed on a weekly basis after the first recorded capture of an E. giganteana adult. Traps were deployed 7 June 2019 to 14 August 2019 and 15 June 2020 to 10 August 2020. In total, there were n = 3 replicates of each semiochemical treatment per field site. The number of E. giganteana and Lepidopteran nontargets was counted on each sticky card after freezing cards at −20 °C for at least 24 h.
For the flight mill assay, six adults were run simultaneously on the six flight mills described in the associated article (15-FMASM SDP Unit, Crist Instrument Co., Hagerstown, MD, USA) to test flight capacity. Each trial was started between 15:00 and 18:00 by gently blowing on the insect to initiate flight and run for 24 h in parallel. Assays were conducted at 21.4 ± 0.01 °C temperature and 54.2 ± 0.2% RH and monitored with a datalogger (UX100-011, Hobo, temp/RH logger, Onset, Bourne, MA, USA). The semiochemical treatments in the flight mill assay included (E)-8-dodecenyl acetate, (Z)-9-dodecenyl acetate, and an unbaited control (acetone solvent only). Semiochemicals were freshly prepared in LDPE dropping bottles, as in the field-baiting experiment (as above), and placed in the center among the flight mills on a nonporous glass surface to prevent contamination. There were 12–18 replicates per treatment. At the end of a trial, insects were detached and weighed on a balance. Data were streamed in real time to a computer which automatically record the flight parameters: distance flown, the number of tandem flight bouts over the sampling interval (flights lasting more than 1 s), mean flight bout duration, and mean distance flown per bout. Data were also parsed by time of date to determine maximum time of dispersal. Data were analyzed with R software.

Data from: Less is more: Fewer attract-and-kill sites improve the male annihilation technique against Bactrocera dorsalis - Catalog,https://catalog.data.gov//dataset/data-from-less-is-more-fewer-attract-and-kill-sites-improve-the-male-annihilation-techniqu-cb0c3,"The Male Annihilation Technique (also termed the Male Attraction Technique; “MAT”) is often used to eradicate pestiferous tephritid fruit flies, such as Bactrocera dorsalis (Hendel). MAT involves the application of male-specific attractants combined with an insecticide in spots or stations across an area to reduce the male population to such a low level that suppression or eradication is achieved. Currently, implementations of MAT in California and Florida targeting B. dorsalis utilize the male attractant methyl eugenol (ME) accompanied with a toxicant, such as spinosad, mixed into a waxy, inert emulsion STATIC ME (termed here “SPLAT-MAT-ME”). While highly effective against ME-responding species, such applications are expensive owing largely to the high cost of the carrier matrix and labor for application.  Until recently the accepted protocol called for the application of approximately 230 SPLAT-MAT-ME spots per km2; however, findings from Hawaii suggest a lower density may actually be more effective. The present study adopted the methods of that earlier work and estimated kill rates of released B. dorsalis under varying spot densities in areas of California and Florida that have had recent incursions of this invasive species. Specifically, we directly compared trap captures of sterilized marked B. dorsalis males released in different plots under three experimental SPLAT-MAT-ME densities (50, 110, and 230 per km2) in Huntington Beach, CA; Anaheim, CA; and Sarasota-Bradenton, FL. The plots with a density of 110 sites per km2 had a significantly higher recapture proportion than plots with 50 or 230 sites per km2. This result suggests that large amounts of male attractant may reduce the ability of males to locate the source of the odor, thus lowering kill rates and the effectiveness of eradication efforts. Eradication programs would directly benefit from reduced costs and improved eradication effectiveness by reducing the application density of SPLAT-MAT-ME.

Trial 1 Recapture - To understand whether the method by which LLIN was deployed affected subsequent commodity infestation and progeny production, pilot-scale warehouses (5.85 × 2.81 m) in Manhattan, KS were used. At the far end of the warehouse against the back wall, a commodity consisting of a mixture of 210 mL organic, whole wheat kernels and 210 mL of organic, unbleached flour was placed. A total of 100 individuals each of T. castaneum, R. dominica, and T. variabile were released at the opposite end of the warehouse (approx. 5.25 m away). There were n = 12 replicate releases per treatment from 26 April 2019 to 16 August 2019, comprising a total of 3,600 released insects. There were four LLIN deployment methods that were tested (Figure 2). In the “hanging” treatment, LLIN (2.72 × 2.41 m) was affixed to the warehouse ceiling and allowed to hang down to the floor, completely bisecting the room. In the “cover” deployment method, LLIN was directly laid over the commodity. In the “pipe” deployment method, a PVC pipe (91 cm length, 5.1 cm I.D.) was bisected halfway with LLIN. These were compared with a ""control"" that used the same PVC pipe design, but without netting. Insects were given 72 h to disperse across the warehouse to the commodity. After this period, insects were collected by pre-designated zones in the warehouse. The zones were noted respective to the location of the commodity, and included ""in commodity"" (inside the commodity), ""partial dispersal"" (0.5 m radius to 4.5 m away), and ""no dispersal"" (4.5 m–5.6 m away, e.g. the release zone).

There were four treatments in total applied to warehouses for this experiment: LLIN alone (L), AK-based interception trap alone (AK), both together (LAK), or neither (e.g. ""control"" that had no netting or interception trap). The zones were similar to the descriptions above, but a Zone 7 was introduced which described insects captured inside the interception traps (e.g. ""trap""). At the far end of the warehouse against the back wall, a commodity consisting of a mixture of 210 mL organic, whole wheat kernels and 210 mL of organic, unbleached flour was placed.

For the vectoring assay, the impact of dispersal (0, 24, or 72 h) and foraging time (3 or 5 d) on vectoring ability were tested.  Briefly, adult L. serricorne or S. oryzae were singly removed from colony containers with sterilized forceps and then placed immediately in the center of Petri dish containing agar for the 0 h dispersal period.  Alternatively, some insects were given a 24 or 72 h dispersal period in an autoclaved 4 L-capacity glass container and stored at constant conditions of 25°C, 60% RH, and 14:10 L:D photoperiod prior to being added to the PDA. Petri dishes were maintained at 30°C, 60% RH, and 14:10 L:D photoperiod for either 3 or 5 days, then photographed for microbial growth. Transfer of L. serricorne or S. oryzae adults from dispersal containers to agar at the conclusion of the dispersal period was performed inside the biosafety cabinet to prevent contamination of dishes.
Pictures of the agar dishes and corresponding microbial growth were taken using a DSLR camera (EOS 7D Mark II, Canon, Tokyo, Japan) mounted to 3D imaging StackShot (CogniSys, Inc., Traverse City, MI, USA) equipped with a dual flash (MT-26EX-RT, Canon, Tokyo, Japan). Light was diffused using a partially cut frosted plastic jar (15.2 × 7.6 cm D:H) making a total of n = 60 replicates per treatment combination (of dispersal time, insect species, and foraging time in patch). The pictures taken were processed using ImageJ 1.53a (Wayne Rasband, National Institutes of Health, USA) to quantify the microbial growth in the agar dishes. The images had their backgrounds subtracted, then were processed using the ""find edges"" tool. Finally, they were converted to binary and either dilated or eroded to conform to the original image parameters. A circle encompassing the Petri dish was created and the mean grayscale, standard deviation of the grayscale value, and count of pixels was measured as a surrogate for microbial growth on the dishes. This allowed a quantitative measure of microbial growth by creating an average in a given image. The mean grayscale value could range from 0 (full white), indicating no microbial growth, to 255 (full black), indicating full microbial growth on the entire dish. Finally, visually, microbial morphospecies (alpha) richness was assigned to each image given the number of unique morphospecies on the plate as a proxy for community complexity. 
Treatments included those from microbially-enriched environments where Aspergillus flavus had been inoculated on wheat or flour (AF). To prepare the AF, 600 g of grain was added to a stainless-steel pot filled with water and placed on a hot plate at 500°C. Once boiling for 15 min, the water was drained and the grain was evenly spread out on sterile wipes (38.1 × 42.5 cm, 3 ply, Tech wipes, Skilcraft, NIB, Alexandria, VA) and allowed to dry inside a laminar fume hood (ca. 3 h). Afterwards, grain was evenly divided (~300 g) and placed in two separate autoclaved mason jars (950-mL capacity). A single hole was pierced through each lid and lined with a cotton ball. The jars were then sealed with aluminum foil and were autoclaved (533LS, Getinge, Rochester, NY, USA) for 30 min. To inoculate with A. flavus, a 3-inch strip of agar containing a pure culture of A. flavus grown on agar for 7 d at 30°C, 60% RH, and 14:10 L:D photoperiod was placed into each jar containing the grain. AF was then maintained at room temperature for roughly 10 d or until the A. flavus evenly covered as much the grain as possible. Batches of inoculated grain were used within 10–15 d of preparation. Grain was never used more than once for each replicate of every trial in each assay experiment to prevent cross contamination. A total of 75 insects were added to 300 g of AF in a 950-ml mason jar and allowed to forage for 2 weeks prior to use in the vectoring experiment. The same dispersal periods (0, 24, 72 h) and time in patch (3 and 5 d) described above were used for this experiment. The mean grayscale value and microbial morphospecies richness was recorded for each image. There were a total of n = 30 replicates per treatment combination.
Another treatment included field-collected individuals. To obtain sufficient numbers of adults, insects were caught at four different field sites around the area of greater Manhattan, KS including: 1) a site with a pre-harvest wheat field bordered by woodlands (39°14'26.2""N, 96°34'59.1""W), 2) local apartment complex consisting of end consumers (39°11'43.6""N, 96°36'07.4""W), 3) Kansas State University Agronomy Farm with storage silos (39°12'23.7""N, 96°35'43.2""W), and 4) a private residence adjacent to a working cattle farm (39°12'23.7""N, 96°35'43.2""W). In each location, a total of three 4-funnel Lindgren traps (Bioquip, Rancho Dominguez, CA, USA) were deployed at least 10 m apart at about 1 m height on rebar or hung from a tree along the perimeter of the location site, and were baited with a multi-species lure containing both L. serricorne sex pheromone and Sitophilus spp. pheromone (PTL bullet lure, #IL-108, and Sitophilus spp. bullet lure, #IL-703, Insects Limited, Westfield, IN, USA). In addition, three ground traps were deployed that consisted of commercially-available pitfall traps (Dome®, Storgard, Trécé, Adair, OK, USA) with two connectable pieces (Doud and Phillips 2020; Doud et al. 2021), containing a central well where a Sitophilus spp. lure was added along with a 5 g of whole maize as a kairomone bait. Pheromone lures were changed every 60 d. No kill mechanism was added because adults needed to be alive. Traps were checked on a daily basis for capture of new adults and brought immediately back into the laboratory in separate unused, sterilized containers for addition to agar dishes. Stored product insects were identified using taxonomic keys in USDA (1996). Dispersal period at 0 h and time in patch (3 and 5 d) as described above were used for this experiment.

Data from: Prolonged Diapause in Mormon Crickets: Embryonic Responses to Three Measures of Time - Catalog,https://catalog.data.gov//dataset/data-from-prolonged-diapause-in-mormon-crickets-embryonic-responses-to-three-measures-of-t-05ca4,"Mormon cricket eggs can remain diapausing in soil for multiple years without forming an embryo. I investigated whether embryonic development was dependent on the number of annual cycles since the egg was laid, duration of the summer period (forcing), or duration of the winter period (chilling). This was a lab experiment conducted at the ARS Northern Plains Agricultural Laboratory in Sidney Montana on two populations: Arizona (AZ, 36.5018 N, 112.1405 W, 2592 m above sea level) and Wyoming (WY, 44.4644 N, 107.4592 W, 2653 m a.s.l). The timing of Mormon cricket egg development was measured for each sibling group (designated mating pairs in the header row) within a population. Hence eggs within sibling groups are considered independent observations, and each sibling group was ultimately analyzed separately. Each sibling group was split into three treatments: 2cycle, 3cycle, and 4cycle (designated 2, 3, and 4 in the data), named for the number of seasonal cycles completed within a 60 week period. Two-cycle is best described as 15 weeks of winter, 3 weeks of spring, 10 weeks of summer, and 2 weeks of autumn; three-cycle is 6 weeks of winter, 2 weeks of spring, 10 weeks of summer, and 2 weeks of autumn; and four-cycle is 6 weeks of winter, 2 weeks of spring, and 5 weeks of summer, and 2 weeks of autumn. For 2cycle and 3cycle, eggs were screened for development in the final two weeks of each cycle (the autumn period), and the developed eggs were separated from the undeveloped eggs. Half-developed eggs (or ‘middies’) were also separated from the undeveloped eggs to follow the completion of their development separately. Initially, eggs in 4cycle were also screened in each ‘autumn’ period, but the embryos were unable to complete development in a single screening. Therefore, we were able to screen 4cycle every other autumn period. For each egg in the sibling group, we tracked the timing of the fate of each egg: either fully developed (and thus ready to enter winter and hatch the following spring), discard (due to being flat, black, or invaded by fungus), broken, mia (or missing in action when accidentally lost), or right censored (for the few eggs in a sibling group that still remained undeveloped at the end of the experiment). Any middies that were found hatched were assumed to have completed development in the prior summer. For some mating pairs, we also collected a few eggs and fixed them, which killed the eggs, but cleared the chorion so that we could review their developmental stages (fate=fixed). The treatments were applied for approximately 10 calendar years starting in 2013 when the eggs were collected and ending in 2023. The timing of the fate of each egg was calculated in three ways: 1) the number of warm periods that the egg had experienced (designated ‘wp’ in the header row), the number of weeks of chill time that the egg had experienced prior to its fate (designated ‘winter chill’), and the number of weeks of warm period that the egg had experienced when its fate was determined (designated ‘summer weeks’ although it also includes the 2 weeks of autumn)."
Data from: Plant strategies for maximizing growth during drought and drought recovery in Solanum melongena L. (eggplant) - Catalog,https://catalog.data.gov//dataset/data-from-plant-strategies-for-maximizing-growth-during-drought-and-drought-recovery-in-so-98fae,"Data usage: This data represents the collection of physiological and biometric data of above- and below-ground plant traits in four species of Solanum melongena of Philippine origin (PHL 4841, PHL 2778, PHL 2789, and Mara). Half of the plants were subjected to significant water deficit, and half again of those deficit plants were allowed to recover after subsequent watering. This data is suitable to serve as a benchmark for trait values in S. melongena, as well as in studies of trait responses to terminal drought and episodic drought in agricultural settings. Traits in this dataset include Leaf Water Potential, total leaf area (cm2), Leaf Canopy temp, Fv/Fm, Photosynthesis, Stomatal Conductance, Transpiration Rate, Water Use Efficiency, Green Leaf Dry Weight, Senesced Leaf Dry Weight, Stem Dry Weight, Total Shoot Dry Weight, Leaf Area Ratio, Specific Leaf Area, Specific Leaf Weight, Basal Fine Root Mass, Total Fine Root Mass, Coarse Roots Mass, Total Root Mass, Root:Shoot Ratio, Total Fine Root length (cm), Total Fine Root Surface Area (m2), Total Fine Root Volume (m3), Specific fine root length (m/g), Root tissue density (g/m3), Fine root length:Leaf area Ratio (cm/çm2), and root mass fraction.
Methods and materials:
A greenhouse experiment was set up to identify physiological traits associated with drought tolerance in eggplant. Solanum melongena genotypes PHL 4841, PHL 2778 and PHL 2789 were chosen based on drought performance in previous field and greenhouse trials (58) of 100 germplasm accessions from the National Plant Genetic Resources Laboratory in the Institute of Plant Breeding, University of the Philippines at Los Baños, Laguna, Philippines. S. melongena ‘Mara’, a released variety from the Institute of Plant Breeding, UP Los Baños was included as a reference variety. Seeds were sown into seedling trays containing fritted clay (Turface Greens Grade, Profile Products, Buffalo Grove, IL, USA) at the end of February in a greenhouse in Fort Collins, CO. After 17-21 days seedlings were transplanted into 7.57 L plastic pots containing 10 kg fritted clay and watered to holding capacity via a drip irrigation before treatments were established. Pots were positioned on two greenhouse benches in a randomized complete block design of two factors: water availability (drought vs. well-watered control) and genotype (four genotypes). There were 5 replicates of each block (40 plants). This basic block design was doubled, and plants were harvested at 2 time points (post-drought and post-recovery) for a total of 80 plants.
Plants were maintained under a combination of natural sunlight and supplemental LED illumination on a 14:10 hour day:night cycle, corresponding to average temperatures of 22 and 29˚C. Plants were fertigated using Grow More water soluble fertilizer (Grow More, Inc., Gardena, CA) amended with additional N in the form of urea and additional K in the form of KH2PO4 to achieve 79.5-22.5-5 ppm N:P:K daily for the first month after transplantation and transitioned to 60-30-120 ppm N:P:K for the remainder of the experiment.
Drought treatments began at 5 weeks after transplanting and lasted for 2 weeks for all blocks (80 plants). “Drought” plants received 30% of evapotranspiration (ET) of “control” plants daily for the first week, and 10% daily in the second week. “Control” plants were given 100% of ET daily. ET was calculated by weighing control pots daily at 1400 hr to measure evaporative and transpiration water loss relative to 100% holding capacity. After the conclusion of the drought treatment, all remaining plants were re-watered to pot holding capacity.
Physiological measurements
Randomized measurements of drought and control plants were carried out from the 11th through the 15th and final day of the drought treatment on 50% of the experimental plant population. On each day, the third fully expanded leaf of each plant was measured for chlorophyll fluorescence (Fv/Fm) from 07:30 until 08:30 using a portable OS5P fluorometer (Opti-Sciences Inc., NH, USA).  Each leaf was dark acclimated with leaf clips for 20 minutes prior to measurement. From 09:00 to 12:00 hrs, the same leaves were measured for photosynthetic rate, stomatal conductance, and transpiration using the Li-COR 6400XT infrared gas analyzer with attached leaf measurement chamber (LiCOR Inc., Lincoln, Nebraska).  Conditions in the leaf measurement chamber were the following: PAR (photosynthetically active radiation) of 1800 µmol m-2s-1, leaf temperature of 25˚C, and CO2 concentration of 400 µmol mol-1. Instantaneous water use efficiency (WUEi) was calculated as the ratio of photosynthesis (An) to stomatal conductance (gs).
Leaf water potential (ΨL) was determined with use of a Scholander pressure chamber (Soil Moisture Equipment Corp., Santa Barbara, CA, USA). The same leaf used for gas exchange measurements was cut from each plant and immediately placed in a plastic bag in a cooler until ΨL could be measured (up to 1 hour).
After one week under full watering, “recovered” and control plants were again measured as above for chlorophyll fluorescence and leaf water potential.
Plant growth measurements
Following physiological measurements, the aboveground portions of drought and control plants were cut and partitioned into leaves and stem. Total leaf area was measured for each plant using a Li-3100C leaf area meter (LiCOR Inc., USA). Partitioned shoot tissue was then oven dried at 60˚C for 48 hours and weighed.
The belowground biomass of each plant was washed free of fritted clay and partitioned into fine and coarse roots. A representative sample of fine roots was obtained for each sample and stored in 30% ethyl alcohol for root scanning. Preserved fine roots were scanned in water in 2-D transparency mode with a desktop scanner (EpsonV750, Epson America Inc., USA) and analyzed using WinRHIZOTM software (Regent Instruments Inc., Canada). Remaining fine and coarse roots were dried and weighed as above. Leaf area ratio (total leaf area per total plant dry mass, m2 g-1; LAR) and specific leaf area (leaf area per leaf dry mass, m2 g-1; SLA), and leaf mass area (leaf dry mass per leaf area, g m-2; LMA) were calculated using the leaf data for each plant. Specific root length of fine roots (root length per dry mass, m g-1; SRLFineRts) and total root mass fraction (RMF, total root mass per total plant weight) were calculated using the fine root length and root biomass data from each plant (31,59)
At the end of the recovery phase, all plants were also destructively sampled for measurement of leaf area and above- and below-ground biomass partitioning as above.

Data from: Experiments on Jackson trap efficiency capturing Bactrocera dorsalis and Zeugodacus cucurbitae - Catalog,https://catalog.data.gov//dataset/data-from-experiments-on-jackson-trap-efficiency-capturing-bactrocera-dorsalis-and-zeugoda-e6056,"Jackson traps baited with male lures with or without insecticides are essential components of surveillance and monitoring programs against pest tephritid fruit flies. The ability of a trap to capture a fly that enters, sometimes termed “trap efficiency”, is dependent on many factors including the trap/lure/toxicant combination. We tested the effects of three important components of Jackson traps on efficiency of capture of two important fruit fly species, using the “standard” (i.e., as they are used in the state-wide surveillance program in California) and alternatives: Insecticide (Naled, DDVP or None), type of adhesive on the sticky panel (Seabright Laboratories Stickem Special Regular or Stickem Special HiTack), and use of a single or combination male lure (Methyl eugenol and/or cuelure). Experiments were conducted in large outdoor carousel olfactometers with known numbers of Bactrocera dorsalis and Zeugodacus cucurbitae and by trapping wild populations of the same two species. Lures were aged out to eight weeks to develop a comprehensive dataset on trap efficiency of the various combinations.  Resources in this "

"Data from: Deer keds and blacklegged ticks infesting ungulates in the United States: molecular detection of Bartonella spp., Rickettsia spp., Anaplasma spp., and Borrelia spp. - Catalog",https://catalog.data.gov//dataset/data-from-deer-keds-and-blacklegged-ticks-infesting-ungulates-in-the-united-states-molecul-7494d,"Deer keds are blood-feeding flies from which several human and animal pathogens have been detected, including the causative agent of Lyme Disease (Borrelia burgdorferi). Cervids, which are the primary hosts of deer keds, are not natural reservoirs of B. burgdorferi, and it has been suggested that deer keds may acquire bacterial pathogens by co-feeding near ticks that are infected with the bacteria. We tested this hypothesis by using a molecular assay to screen for presence of Anaplasma spp., Bartonella spp., Borrelia spp., and Rickettsia spp. in specimens of European deer keds (n=306) and blacklegged ticks (n=315) collected from 38 individual white-tailed deer in Pennsylvania. There was limited similarity in the bacterial DNA detected between these ectoparasites per host, suggesting that co-feeding may not be a mechanism by which deer keds acquire these bacteria. We discuss these results in relation to deer ked feeding biology, life history, and collection timepoints. In addition, we screened specimens of European deer keds (n=410), Neotropical deer keds (n=13), Western American deer keds (n=10), and Pacific deer keds (n=14) for these same bacterial pathogens.

Data from: Conservation Practices Induce Tradeoffs in Soil Function: Observations from the Northern Great Plains - Catalog,https://catalog.data.gov//dataset/data-from-conservation-practices-induce-tradeoffs-in-soil-function-observations-from-the-n-6eaab,"Cropland expansion and reduced crop rotation diversity throughout the northern Great Plains has negatively impacted soil quality, creating a need to identify conservation practices that can counteract this trend. A study was conducted to quantify soil property responses to crop diversity/intensity, cover crops, and livestock integration under controlled experimental conditions, and land use (dryland cropping, native grassland, untilled pasture) on working farms and ranches, all on a common soil type in southcentral North Dakota, USA. Data from this study included near-surface (0-5 cm) measurements of soil physical, chemical, and biological properties over a 3-yr period for contrasting long-term experimental treatments at the USDA-ARS Northern Great Plains Research Laboratory, Mandan, North Dakota. Soil profile (0-100 cm) assessments of soil physical and chemical properties complemented near-surface measurements. Data were used to generate soil quality index scores using the Soil Management Assessment Framework. Annual spring wheat grain yields for experimental treatments complemented soils data. Similar evaluations were conducted on six on-farm sites in Emmons County, North Dakota, USA, but only for one year and without grain yield data. Data may be used to better understand soil property responses to cropland conservation practices and different land uses. Data are generally applicable to rainfed conditions under a semiarid Continental climate for Temvik-Wilton silt loams (fine silty, mixed, superactive, frigid Typic and Pachic Haplustolls) and associated soil types (i.e., Grassna, Linton, Mandan, and Williams).

"Multispectral images and field measurements of water depth from the Sacramento River near Glenn, California, acquired September 14-16, 2021 - Catalog",https://catalog.data.gov//dataset/multispectral-images-and-field-measurements-of-water-depth-from-the-sacramento-river-ne-16,"This data release includes multispectral images and field measurements of water depth from the Sacramento River near Glenn, California, used to evaluate the potential for efficient reach-scale mapping of river bathymetry using Uncrewed Aircraft Systems (UAS). The images were acquired by a MicaSense RedEdge-MX Dual Camera deployed from a Trinity F90 vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) UAS. The 4 km long study area along the Sacramento River was subdivided into three distinct but adjacent areas of interest (AOIs) and image data were collected from one AOI each day between September 14 and 16, 2021. The image data were ortho-rectified using Quantum-Systems QBase 3D and Agisoft Metashape software and saved as GeoTIFF files. A header text file is also included with each of the images and includes information on the 10 bands of the MicaSense RedEdge-MX Dual Camera, which include: 
Band 1 (Coastal blue): 444 nm
Band 2 (Blue): 475 nm
Band 3 (Green): 531 nm
Band 4 (Green): 560 nm
Band 5 (Red): 650 nm
Band 6 (Red): 668 nm
Band 7 (Red Edge): 705 nm
Band 8 (Red Edge): 717 nm
Band 9 (Red Edge): 740 nm
Band 10 (Near Infrared): 842 nm
Each image has an associated ENVI format header text file that also contains this spectral information. The pixel values for these images are digital numbers between 0 and 65535 for all 10 spectral bands. To convert these digital numbers to reflectance values between 0 and 1, divide each pixel value in each band by 32768. To display the images as a familiar true-color composite, band 5 can be displayed as red, band 4 as green, and band 2 as blue.
Water depths were measured directly in the field to calibrate relationships between depth and reflectance and to assess the accuracy of image-derived depth estimates. In shallow areas along the margins of the channel, depth measurements were made while wading with a Trimble R10 real-time kinematic (RTK) global navigation satellite system (GNSS) receiver to record spatial coordinates and riverbed elevations. Additional points along the edge of the water were surveyed to capture the water surface elevation and depths for points within the channel were calculated by subtracting the local bed elevation from the nearest water surface elevation. For deeper areas that could not be waded safely, another Trimble R10 RTK GNSS receiver was mounted on a boat with an outboard motor and connected to a Seafloor Systems SonarMite echo sounder that measured the water depth. The boat-based data were collected along a series of 25 channel-spanning cross sections and one longitudinal profile that extended over the full length of the study area.
The map projection and datum for the shapefiles and GeoTIFF images contained in this data release are UTM Zone 10 N and NAD83, respectively. Each shapefile has coordinates in units of meters and the depth measurements are also in meters."

An aggregated dataset of serially collected influenza A virus morbidity and titer measurements from virus-infected ferrets. - Catalog,https://catalog.data.gov//dataset/an-aggregated-dataset-of-serially-collected-influenza-a-virus-morbidity-and-titer-measurem,"Data from influenza A virus (IAV) infected ferrets (Mustela putorius furo) provides invaluable information towards the study of novel and emerging viruses that pose a threat to human health. This gold standard animal model can recapitulate many clinical signs of infection present in IAV-infected humans, support virus replication of human and zoonotic strains without prior adaptation, and permit evaluation of virus transmissibility by multiple modes. While ferrets have been employed in risk assessment settings for >20 years, results from this work are typically reported in discrete stand-alone publications, making aggregation of raw data from this work over time nearly impossible. Here, we describe a dataset of 728 ferrets inoculated with 126 unique IAV, conducted by a single research group (NCIRD/ID/IPB/Pathogenesis Laboratory Team) under a uniform experimental protocol. This collection of morbidity, mortality, and viral titer data represents the largest publicly available dataset to date of in vivo-generated IAV infection outcomes on a per-individual ferret level."

Fast Longwave And SHortwave Fluxes (FLASHflux) Clouds and Radiative Swath (SSF) data in netCDF - Catalog,https://catalog.data.gov//dataset/fast-longwave-and-shortwave-fluxes-flashflux-clouds-and-radiative-swath-ssf-data-in-netcdf-f6001,"FLASH_SSF_NOAA20-FM6-VIIRS_Version1A data are near real-time CERES observed TOA fluxes, clouds, and parameterized surface fluxes, not officially calibrated. The Fast Longwave and SHortwave Flux (FLASHFlux) data are a product line of the Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy Systems (CERES) project designed for processing and release of top-of-atmosphere (TOA) and surface radiative fluxes within one week of CERES instrument measurement. The FLASHFlux data product is a rapid-release product based on the algorithms developed for and data collected by the CERES project. CERES is currently producing world-class climate data products derived from measurements taken aboard NASA's Terra and Aqua spacecraft. While of exceptional fidelity, these data products require considerable processing time to assure quality, verify accuracy, and assess precision. The result is that CERES data are typically released up to six months after acquiring the initial measurements. Such delays are of little consequence for climate studies, especially considering the improved quality of the released data products. Thus, FLASHFlux products are not intended to achieve climate quality.FLASHFlux data products were envisioned as a resource whereby CERES data could be provided to the community within a week of the initial measurements, with some calibration accuracy requirements relaxed to gain speed. The Single Scanner Footprint TOA/Surface Fluxes and Clouds (SSF) product contains one hour of instantaneous Fast Longwave And SHortwave Fluxes (FLASHFlux) data for a single Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy Systems (CERES) scanner instrument. The SSF combines instantaneous CERES data with scene information from a higher-resolution imager such as the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) on the NOAA-20 satellite and meteorological and ozone information from The Goddard Earth Observing System GEOS-5 FP-IT Atmospheric Data Assimilation System (GEOS-5 ADAS). Scene identification and cloud properties are defined at the higher imager resolution, and these data are averaged over the larger CERES footprint. For each CERES footprint, the SSF contains Top-of-Atmosphere fluxes in SW, LW, and incoming NET, surface fluxes using the Langley parameterized shortwave and longwave algorithms, and cloud information.CERES is a key Earth Observing System (EOS) program component. The CERES instruments provide radiometric measurements of the Earth's atmosphere from three broadband channels. The CERES mission is a follow-up to the successful Earth Radiation Budget Experiment (ERBE) mission. The first CERES instrument (PFM) was launched on November 27, 1997, as part of the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM). Two CERES instruments (FM1 and FM2) were launched into polar orbit on board the EOS flagship Terra on December 18, 1999. Two additional CERES instruments (FM3 and FM4) were launched on board EOS Aqua on May 4, 2002. CERES instrument Flight Model 5 (FM5) was launched on board the Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (NPP) satellite on October 28, 2011.

Macroinvertebrate Inventory at Big Bend National Park 2022 - Open Format Dataset - Catalog,https://catalog.data.gov//dataset/macroinvertebrate-inventory-at-big-bend-national-park-2022-open-format-dataset,"This study examined the biological response of aquatic organisms, collected in situ and from laboratory toxicity testing of water and soil to the herbicide Arsenal® primarily used to decrease the invasive species Arundo donax in the Rio Grande River through Big Bend National Park in Texas (USA). Biological, toxicological, physicochemical, and flow data were collected before, during, and after treatment from 4 reference and 3 treatment sites. Significant differences existed in scoring, and in toxicity testing of water and sediment, between treatment and reference sites. Greater toxicity was observed in sediment samples compared to water samples. This could be due to the surfactant nonylphenol ethoxylate (NPE), added to the Arsenal® formulation rather than the active ingredient imazapyr. Care must be implemented with the results of this research due to many confounding variables that occurred during the study period. Flooding could impact the sediment toxicity results as sediment-bound contaminants could be spread some distance from their origin. Due to treatment timing this represented an extreme condition as far as concentration of potential toxicants in the water are concerned and these relatively high concentrations would be expected to have decreased within a relatively short period of time, especially in the water. We believe the findings from this study provide indication of potential toxicity of some magnitude as well as provide direction for management. Decisions of whether the toxic effects of herbicide use to aquatic macroinvertebrates outweigh the beneficial effects of Arundo donax control should be carefully considered."

Each raster is derived from a historical observation made by one of five Landsat satellites. Surface reflectance in the green and shortwave infrared wavelengths are used to classify the aufeis occurrence within individual pixels. Pixel values of ""1"" correspond to aufeis presence while ""0"" corresponds to its absence. Rasters are generated from cloud and snow-filtered images captured between May and September for the years 1985-2022."

The Coastwide Reference Monitoring System (CRMS) was developed to assist in a multiple-reference approach that uses aspects of hydrogeomorphic functional assessments and probabilistic sampling for monitoring. The CRMS program includes a suite of approximately 398 sites that encompass the range of hydrological and ecological conditions for each stratum. As part of CRMS, land and water classifications are created from Digital Orthophoto Quarter Quadrangles (DOQQs) approximately every three years at all CRMS sites. A DOQQ is a raster image in which displacement in the image caused by sensor orientation and terrain relief has been removed and combines the image characteristics of a photo with geometric qualities of a map. The DOQQs generated for this project consist of 2021 Color Infrared (CIR) Digital Imagery. These images were classified into land and water categories using a threshold of the near infrared (NIR) band, followed by supervised and unsupervised classification.  Initial classification results are then reviewed by multiple image analysts to identify and manually recode errors. The final land-water classifications are intended to serve as both geographic and quantitative assessments of landscape composition on the date of acquisition. Five previous assessments have been conducted (2005, 2008, 2012, 2015/2016, and 2018).

A DOQQ is a raster image in which displacement in the image caused by sensor orientation and terrain relief has been removed and combines the image characteristics of a photo with geometric qualities of a map. The DOQQs generated for this project consist of 2021 Color Infrared (CIR) Digital Imagery. These images were classified into land and water categories using a threshold of the near infrared (NIR) band, followed by supervised and unsupervised classification.  Initial classification results are then reviewed by multiple image analysts to identify and manually recode errors. The final land-water classifications are intended to serve as both geographic and quantitative assessments of landscape composition on the date of acquisition. Five previous assessments have been conducted (2005, 2008, 2012, 2015/2016, and 2018). Once the program creates enough data points for statistical analyses, these data will be used for land area change rate calculation."

The GW-NDST relies on an ensemble of calibrated parameters to make nitrate predictions and to estimate the uncertainty of those predictions. This data release contains all of the calibrated parameter files required to run the tool. The files are packaged in a single ZIP file. To run the tool, the ZIP package needs to be downloaded and extracted within the pest/ies_parameter_ensembles/ subdirectory within GW-NDST file structure. There are eleven parameter files contained within this zip file (one for each parameter group). Each of these files are compressed numpy .npy files that contain 3-dimensional arrays of parameter values."

Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) requests burn severity assessments through an agreement with the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) to be completed by analysts with the Monitoring Trends in Burn Severity (MTBS) Program. These data products are burned area boundary shapefiles derived from post-fire sensor data (including Landsat TM, Landsat ETM+, Landsat OLI). The pre-fire and post-fire subsets included were used to create Normalized Burn Ratio (NBR) and then a differenced Normalized Burn Ratio (dNBR) image. The objective of this assessment was to generate burned area boundaries for each fire. Data bundles also include post-fire subset, pre-fire subset, NBR, and dNBR images. This map layer is a thematic raster image of burn severity classes for all inventoried fires occurring in CONUS during calendar year 1995. Fires omitted from this mapped inventory are those where suitable satellite imagery was not available, or fires which were not discernable from available imagery."
"Seafloor character offshore of Arcata, California - Catalog",https://catalog.data.gov//dataset/seafloor-character-offshore-of-arcata-california,"This seafloor character raster for the Offshore of Arcata, California, map area is part of USGS Data Series 781 (Golden and Cochrane, 2019).

"Thermal maps of the 2018 lower East Rift Zone eruption of Kilauea Volcano, Island of Hawai`i - Catalog",https://catalog.data.gov//dataset/thermal-maps-of-the-2018-lower-east-rift-zone-eruption-of-kilauea-volcano-island-of-hawaii-effe2,"The 2018 eruption of Kīlauea Volcano included both a large effusive eruption on the lower East Rift Zone and associated collapse and subsidence of the caldera floor at the summit (Anderson and others 2019; Neal and others 2019; Patrick and others 2020).  Lava erupted from 24 fissures on the lower East Rift Zone over four months, with high effusion rates (>100 m3 s-1) often supplying lava into channelized flows (Dietterich and others 2021).  This effusion produced an extensive lava flow field, covering 36 km2 and creating 3.5 km2 of new land along the coast (Zoeller and others 2020).  The eruption was notable for the sustained high effusion rates, which produced complex and prolonged evolution of the lava flow field, dominated by the large channelized flow from fissure 8 that extended 13 km from the vent to the ocean.  The eruption had a severe impact on the community, destroying over 700 structures in the lower Puna district (Meredith and others 2022). 
In this data release, we include thermal maps of the eruption that document the highly dynamic evolution of the lava flow field on the lower East Rift Zone during this 2018 eruption.  The thermal maps were constructed from oblique airborne imagery from a handheld thermal camera, using structure-from-motion software to construct thermal orthomosaics.  The maps were generally made every 1-3 days, thus providing a sequence to illustrate how the flow field changed through the course of the eruption.  These data are meant to better understand the behavior of large channelized lava flows, in order to improve forecasting their hazards in the future. "

These projects included marsh, beach, and dune restoration, aquatic connectivity, and living shoreline installation, among others.  To evaluate restoration efforts of the Hurricane Sandy Coastal Resiliency Program, the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) studied two marsh sites of coastal systems in southeast New Jersey that underwent restoration. Submerged sensors were deployed to measure water velocity, water quality, water level, and waves. Water quality data collection included optical turbidity measurements that were calibrated to suspended sediment mass using in-situ, lab filtered water samples. These data will be used to calculate sediment fluxes and ecological resilience metrics at the two marsh sites."

Russian River Integrated Hydrologic Model (RRIHM): Wells - Catalog,https://catalog.data.gov//dataset/russian-river-integrated-hydrologic-model-rrihm-wells-d888f,"The Russian River Watershed (RRW) covers about 1300 square miles (without Santa Rosa Plain) of urban, agricultural, and forested lands in northern Sonoma County and southern Mendocino County, California. Communities in the RRW depend on a combination of Russian River water and groundwater to meet their water-supply demands. Water is used primarily for agricultural irrigation, municipal and private wells supply, and commercial uses - such as for wineries and recreation. Annual rainfall in the RRW is highly variable, making it prone to droughts and flooding from atmospheric river events. In order to better understand surface-water and groundwater issues, the USGS is creating a Coupled Ground-Water and Surface-Water Flow Model (GSFLOW; Markstrom and others, 2008) of the RRW. This model will include climate, geology, surface-water, groundwater, and land-use data.

"Sea-level rise and high tide flooding inundation probability and depth statistics at De Soto National Memorial, Florida - Catalog",https://catalog.data.gov//dataset/sea-level-rise-and-high-tide-flooding-inundation-probability-and-depth-statistics-at-de-so,"This dataset includes elevation-based probability and depth statistics for estimating inundation under various sea-level rise and high tide flooding scenarios in and around the National Park Service’s De Soto National Memorial. These datasets were developed using 1-m digital elevation model (DEM) from the 3D Elevation program. This data release includes results from analyses of two local sea-level rise scenarios for two-time steps — the Intermediate-Low and Intermediate-High for 2050 and 2100 from Sweet and others (2022). Additionally, this data release includes maps of inundation probability under the minor, moderate, and major high tide flooding thresholds defined by the National oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). We estimated the probability of an area being inundated under a given scenario using Monte Carlo simulations with 1,000 iterations. For an individual iteration, each pixel of the DEM was randomly propagated based on the lidar data uncertainty, while the sea-level rise and high tide flooding water level estimates were also propagated based on uncertainty in the estimate (Sweet and others, 2022) and tidal datum transformation, respectively. Moreover, the probability of a pixel being inundated was calculated by summing the binary simulation outputs and dividing by 1,000. Following, probability was binned into the following classes: 1) Unlikely, probability ≤0.33; 2) Likely as not, probability >0.33 and ≤0.66; and 3) Likely, probability >0.66. Finally, depth statistics were only recorded when depth was equal to or greater than 0. We calculated the median depth, 25th percentile, 75th percentile, and interquartile range using all the pixels that met this criterion. When utilizing the depth statistics, it is important to also consider the probability of this pixel being flooded. In other words, the depth layers may show some depth returns, but the pixel may have rarely been inundated for the 1,000 iterations."

The CRMS program includes a suite of approximately 398 sites that encompass the range of hydrological and ecological conditions for each stratum. As part of CRMS, land and water classifications are created from Digital Orthophoto Quarter Quadrangles (DOQQs) approximately every three years at all CRMS sites. A DOQQ is a raster image in which displacement in the image caused by sensor orientation and terrain relief has been removed and combines the image characteristics of a photo with geometric qualities of a map. The DOQQs generated for this project consist of 2021 Color Infrared (CIR) Digital Imagery. These images were classified into land and water categories using a threshold of the near infrared (NIR) band, followed by supervised and unsupervised classification.  Initial classification results are then reviewed by multiple image analysts to identify and manually recode errors. The final land-water classifications are intended to serve as both geographic and quantitative assessments of landscape composition on the date of acquisition. Five previous assessments have been conducted (2005, 2008, 2012, 2015/2016, and 2018). Once the program creates enough data points for statistical analyses, these data will be used for land area change rate calculation."

"Topographic, aerial imagery, and unoccupied aerial vehicle (UAV) data for an aeolian dune field near Lees Ferry, AZ - Catalog",https://catalog.data.gov//dataset/topographic-aerial-imagery-and-unoccupied-aerial-vehicle-uav-data-for-an-aeolian-dune-fiel,"These data were compiled for assessing how geomorphic changes measured as topographic differences from repeat surveys represent measured and modelled estimates of aeolian sediment transport and dune mobility. Objective(s) of our study were to investigate whether topographic changes can serve as a proxy for aeolian transport and sediment mobility in dunefield environments. This was accomplished by relating topographic changes to modeled and observed estimates of sediment transport and dune mobility over months to decades within a partially vegetated dunefield starved of upwind sediment supplies. We specifically tested if topographic changes measured as net and total volume changes and topographic surface roughness differences provide evidence for intra-annual differences and decadal changes in sediment mobility for dune sand that is either currently bare, vegetated, or biocrust-covered. Lastly, these data were used as a framework for interpreting how aeolian transport and sediment mobility has changed for current land cover types over the preceding four decades. These data represent monthly topographic surveys and in-field sediment transport data collected between February 13, 2020 and December 16, 2020, piloted aerial imagery collected in 1984, 2002, 2009, 2013, and 2021, unoccupied aerial vehicle (UAV) imagery collected in March 2021, classification of land cover, and tabular summaries of topographic changes derived from these datasets. These data were collected between 1984 and 2021 within a small aeolian dunefield near the confluence of the Paria and Colorado Rivers, upstream of Grand Canyon National Park, Arizona. These data were collected by the U.S. Geological Survey. These data can be used to 1) to evaluate how dune surfaces with bare sand, sand with vegetated cover, and sand with biological soil crust cover (biocrust) change on a monthly time scale with differences in wind strength and 2) assess how the dunefield surface changed with vegetation loss and expansion over almost 4 decades. Additionally, these data could be used to assess detailed changes in landscape cover over monthly and decadal time scales."
Catch and Biomass per unit effort of fishes in two Northern Wisconsin lakes from 2017-2021 - Catalog,https://catalog.data.gov//dataset/catch-and-biomass-per-unit-effort-of-fishes-in-two-northern-wisconsin-lakes-from-2017-2021,"Inland lake ecosystems are transforming due to unprecedented effects of climate changes and disturbance along riparian habitat, diminishing their potential to support fisheries. Walleye Sander vitreus, the most sought-after game fish in north-central North America supporting robust recreational and tribal fisheries, have declined. Climate change, harvest, invasive species, and concurrent increases in warm-water species (e.g., Centrarchidae) are implicated in declines. The Resist-Accept-Direct (RAD) framework provides a structure to reconcile managing ecosystem transformations. To examine the utility of intensive resist actions, we conducted an experimental removal of centrarchids in a north temperate lake. We removed ~300,000 centrarchids from a lake over four years while monitoring the fish community response. Centrarchid abundance declined, yet we found no evidence of walleye recruitment but yellow perch Perca flavescens greatly increased. We present these findings to discuss the feasibility of resistance as a management strategy in supporting walleye fisheries facing environmental change as well as a segue for management discussions to move beyond traditional resist strategies when navigating ecosystem change."
"Data from temperature-depth measurements in research drillhole Y-7, Upper Geyser Basin, Yellowstone National Park - Catalog",https://catalog.data.gov//dataset/data-from-temperature-depth-measurements-in-research-drillhole-y-7-upper-geyser-basin-yell,"Active thermal areas in Yellowstone National Park provide insight into a variety of hydrothermal processes occurring at depth, such as water-rock interactions, the formation of alteration minerals, and microbial (thermophile) metabolism in extreme environments. Research drill hole Y-7 (44°29'8.74"", -110°51'7.67"") is one of 13 holes completed by the U.S. Geological Survey in 1967 and 1968 at selected sites in hot spring and geyser areas of the park (White and others, 1975). The holes were drilled with a goal of obtaining physical and chemical data on the shallow part of the hydrothermal system. Drill hole Y-7 is located at the northern end of the Biscuit Basin parking lot, in the northern part of the Upper Geyser Basin. Drilling of Y-7 in September 1967 started from an elevation of ~2,529 meters and reaching a total depth of 84 meters. A temperature of 143.1 °C was measured at a depth of 82 meters a week after drilling was completed, and a temperature of 141.6 °C was measured in September 1973 (White et al., 1975).
Following drilling, a 4-inch (10 centimeters) casing was installed to a depth of 7 meters and 3-inch (8 centimeters) casing was installed to a depth of 35 meters. In subsequent years, studies of hydrothermal alteration chemistry and mineralogy in core samples from drill hole Y-7 were conducted (Keith et al., 1978; Sturchio et al., 1986). Water that was pumped from the drill hole in 2015 was analyzed for dissolved gas concentrations and for major and trace element chemistry (Hurwitz et al., 2016; McCleskey et al., 2022).
The data release reports temperature-depth data from drill hole Y-7 measured 6 times between March 2002 and April 2015 under research permit YELL-SCI-5290. In March 2002, September 2002, June 2003, and June 2004, temperature was measured with a K-type thermocouple wire that was labeled every 5 feet. The thermocouple wire was connected to a handheld pre-calibrated temperature logger. Depth measurements are referenced to the top of the wellhead and were made at intervals of 10 or 20 feet with a depth accuracy of 1 foot. Temperature accuracy is 0.5 °C. The thermocouple was held at every measurement depth until no temperature changes were observed.
In April 2012 and April 2015, temperature measurements were made with the stop-go temperature logging method (Harris and Chapman, 2007) using the USGS portable temperature-measuring gear with a hand-cranked cable reel with four-conductor wire and a calibrated platinum resistance temperature (PRT) sensors that typically provide an accuracy of 0.1°C and precision of 0.01°C. The PRT probe was lowered into the well over a sheave and temperature was measured at depth intervals of 5 or 10 feet with a depth resolution conservatively estimated at ± 1 foot. The PRT probe was held at every measurement depth until no temperature changes exceeding 0.1°C were observed. Periodic calibration checks of the PRT probe were performed in a temperature-controlled water bath using an ASTM certified mercury thermometer in a USGS laboratory in Menlo Park, California.
The column headers in the data file (Y-7_Temperature_Depth.csv) are the depth of the temperature measurement in feet and in meters and the dates of the temperature measurement (month/day/year).

The data accompanies a USGS scientific investigations map from Anderson and Lundgren (2024).
The Standing Rock Sioux Tribe (the Tribe) and the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) completed a comprehensive assessment of groundwater resources within the Standing Rock Indian Reservation.Generalized potentiometric surfaces of the Fort Union, Hell Creek, and Fox Hills aquifers were constructed to assess the groundwater resources of the Standing Rock Indian Reservation. Water-level data from the U.S. Geological Survey Groundwater Site Inventory (GWSI) database, the North Dakota Department of Water Resources (NDDWR), and the South Dakota Department of Agriculture and Natural Resources (SDDANR) were compiled and used to construct generalized potentiometric-surface maps representing average conditions of the Fort Union, Hell Creek, and Fox Hills Formations. The water-level measurements mean was used for wells with more than one water-level measurement. Recorded depth to water-levels were converted to hydraulic head by subtracting the water level from the land-surface elevation at the well location. Hydraulic-head values were spatially interpolated to create 2-dimensional potentiometric surfaces. The interpolated potentiometric surfaces were contoured using contour intervals of 50 ft and smoothed to correct for extreme changes in the potentiometric surfaces in areas of sparse data."

The Coastwide Reference Monitoring System (CRMS) was developed to assist in a multiple-reference approach that uses aspects of hydrogeomorphic functional assessments and probabilistic sampling for monitoring. The CRMS program includes a suite of approximately 398 sites that encompass the range of hydrological and ecological conditions for each stratum. As part of CRMS, land and water classifications are created from Digital Orthophoto Quarter Quadrangles (DOQQs) approximately every three years at all CRMS sites. A DOQQ is a raster image in which displacement in the image caused by sensor orientation and terrain relief has been removed and combines the image characteristics of a photo with geometric qualities of a map. The DOQQs generated for this project consist of 2021 Color Infrared (CIR) Digital Imagery. These images were classified into land and water categories using a threshold of the near infrared (NIR) band, followed by supervised and unsupervised classification.  Initial classification results are then reviewed by multiple image analysts to identify and manually recode errors. The final land-water classifications are intended to serve as both geographic and quantitative assessments of landscape composition on the date of acquisition. Five previous assessments have been conducted (2005, 2008, 2012, 2015/2016, and 2018). Once the program creates enough data points for statistical analyses, these data will be used for land area change rate calculation."

We built three sets of ensemble species distribution models (SDMs) for each species. We first built global and regional ensemble distribution models for each species. Then, to create a comprehensive estimate of potential invasive species distribution for our study species in Hawaiʻi, we built nested regional models that integrate our global and regional ensemble models. This approach and the resulting mapped distributions are the most comprehensive to date for Hawaiian invasive plants and can possibly be applied more broadly to other species in the future.

Shoreline change rates were calculated for two time periods: pre-Sandy (2010-2012) and post-Sandy (2012-2022). The profiles were derived from light detection and ranging (lidar) digital elevation models (DEMs). Refer to Doran and others (2017) for more information about the source lidar data. These data support the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation (NFWF)-funded project entitled “Monitoring Hurricane Sandy Beach and Marsh Resilience in New York and New Jersey” (NFWF project ID 2300.16.055110), for which the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) St. Petersburg Coastal and Marine Science Center (SPCMSC) is using remotely-sensed data and targeted in-situ observations to monitor the post-restoration evolution of beaches, dunes, vegetative cover, and sediment budgets at seven post-Hurricane Sandy restoration sites in New York and New Jersey."
Site characterization and regeneration attributes of managed and unmanaged ponderosa pine sites in the southwestern United States - Catalog,https://catalog.data.gov//dataset/site-characterization-and-regeneration-attributes-of-managed-and-unmanaged-ponderosa-pine-,"These data consist of environmental covariates, measured plot-level and tree characteristics for seven coniferous tree species across the southwestern United States. The objectives of the study were to assess how growth characteristics of conifer tree species vary across environmental gradients and across the different tree species. These data represent conifer growth under a variety of stand and site characteristics. These data were collected in the summer of 2019, from sites across Nevada, Arizona, New Mexico and Colorado, and collected by field crews directed by Matt Petrie (University of Nevada Las Vegas), Rob Hubbard (USDA Forest Service), Tom Kolb (Northern Arizona University) and John Bradford (U.S. Geological Survey). We selected six locations to encompass a wide range of regional climate conditions. Within each location, we selected sites to capture diversity in local factors expected to influence regeneration including topography, adult tree density, vegetation characteristics, management action, and disturbance. To include more and less sheltered forest microsites in each plot, we located the center of each plot at the boundary between a moderately sized forest interspace and a higher density area, using a spherical densiometer to estimate the midpoint of this boundary for each site based on canopy cover. Interspace sizes differed for each forest site, such that in a dense forest stand a moderate interspace was smaller (∼ 10-100 m−2) than that of a thinned forest stand, where a moderate interspace was in some cases > 1.0 ha in area (10,000 m2). Sites were located on shallow slopes when possible (< 10◦). Recognizing the important influence of soil properties and soil parent material on regeneration, we selected sites with similar texture (sandy loams, loamy sands) at each study location to minimize edaphic influence between our regional study locations. We did not pre-evaluate regeneration in the field prior to setting plot boundaries. We note that some of our sites were located in different environments (differing canopy covers, understory vegetation and debris, adult tree densities, etc.) within the same forest management unit, and other sites were located in nearby managed and unmanaged forest stands. These data can be used to assess how environmental conditions and site characteristics may influence conifer tree regeneration."

Backscatter data were collected by Fugro Pelagos in 2007 using a combination of 400-kHz Reson 7125, 240-kHz Reson 8101, and 100-kHz Reson 8111 multibeam echosounder systems. The data were post-processed by the California State University Monterey Bay Seafloor Mapping. The acoustic backscatter data are available as a georeferenced TIFF image. Within the final imagery, brighter tones indicate higher backscatter intensity, and darker tones indicate lower backscatter intensity. The intensity represents a complex interaction between the acoustic pulse and the seafloor, as well as characteristics within the shallow subsurface, providing a general indication of seafloor texture and composition. Backscatter intensity depends on the acoustic source level; the frequency used to image the seafloor; the grazing angle; the composition and character of the seafloor, including grain size, water content, bulk density, and seafloor roughness; and some biological cover. Harder and rougher bottom types such as rocky outcrops or coarse sediment typically return stronger intensities (high backscatter, lighter tones), whereas softer bottom types such as fine sediment return weaker intensities (low backscatter, darker tones)."

Federal guidelines for peak-flow frequency analyses, provided in Bulletin 17C, assume that the statistical properties of the hydrologic processes driving variability in peak flows do not change over time and so the frequency distribution of annual peak flows is stationary. Better understanding of long-term climatic persistence and further consideration of potential climate and land-use changes have caused the assumption of stationarity to be reexamined. This data release contains input data and results of a study investigating hydroclimatic trends in peak streamflow (peak flow) in the Central United States, including nine states (Iowa, Illinois, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota, and Wisconsin).

Data release for climate change impacts on surface water extents across the central United States - Catalog,https://catalog.data.gov//dataset/data-release-for-climate-change-impacts-on-surface-water-extents-across-the-central-united,"High-frequency observations of surface water at fine spatial scales are critical to effectively manage aquatic habitat, flood risk and water quality. We developed inundation algorithms for Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 across 12 sites within the conterminous United States (CONUS) covering >536,000 km2 and representing diverse hydrologic and vegetation landscapes. These algorithms were trained on data from 13,412 points spread throughout the 12 sites. Each scene in the 5-year (2017-2021) time series was classified into open water, vegetated water, and non-water at 20 m resolution using variables not only from Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2, but also variables derived from topographic and weather datasets. The Sentinel-1 model was developed distinct from the Sentinel-2 model to enable the two time series to be integrated into a single high-frequency time series, while open water and vegetated water were both mapped to retain mixed pixel inundation. Results were validated against 7,200 visually inspected points derived from WorldView and PlanetScope imagery. Classification accuracy for open water was high across the 5-year period, with an omission and commission error of only 3.1% and 0.9% for Sentinel-1 and 3.1% and 0.5% for Sentinel-2, respectively. Vegetated water accuracy was lower, as expected given that the class represents mixed pixels. Sentinel-2 showed higher accuracy (10.7% omission and 7.9% commission error) relative to Sentinel-1 (28.4% omission and 16.0% commission error). Our results demonstrated that Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 time series can be integrated to improve the temporal resolution when mapping open and vegetated waters, although sensor-specific differences, such as sensitivity to vegetation structure versus pixel color, complicate the data integration for subpixel, vegetated water compared with open water."

We simulated patterns of forest recruitment and succession in a 2200 ha portion of the Upper Mississippi River floodplain with and without removal of invasive Phalaris arundinacea and under two different future 100-year hydrological scenarios: a future maintaining the average flooding conditions of the past 40 years (random) and a future that projects an observed upward 40-year trend in flooding conditions forward (trending). By comparing mapped outputs between scenarios that included Phalaris removal and ones that did not, we were able to identify locations where Phalaris was the main driver of forest loss. We employed the Resist-Accept-Direct (RAD) framework to discuss potential management options to resist changes and maintain forest cover where Phalaris is likely to be the main driver of forest loss and to accept or direct changes in areas where forest loss is likely driven by hydrological change."
"Sea-level rise and high tide flooding inundation probability and depth statistics at Biscayne National Park, Florida - Catalog",https://catalog.data.gov//dataset/sea-level-rise-and-high-tide-flooding-inundation-probability-and-depth-statistics-at-bisca,"This dataset includes elevation-based probability and depth statistics for estimating inundation under various sea-level rise and high tide flooding scenarios in and around the National Park Service’s Biscayne National Park. For information on the digital elevation model (DEM) source used to develop these datasets refer to the corresponding spatial metadata file (Danielson and others, 2023). This data release includes results from analyses of two local sea-level rise scenarios for two-time steps — the Intermediate-Low and Intermediate-High for 2040 and 2080 from Sweet and others (2022). Additionally, this data release includes maps of inundation probability under the minor, moderate, and major hight tide flooding thresholds. We estimated the probability of an area being inundated under a given scenario using Monte Carlo simulations with 1,000 iterations. For an individual iteration, each pixel of the DEM was randomly propagated based on the lidar data uncertainty, while the sea-level rise and high tide flooding water level estimates were also propagated based on uncertainty in the estimate (Sweet and others, 2022) and tidal datum transformation. Moreover, the probability of a pixel being inundated was calculated by summing the binary simulation outputs and dividing by 1,000. Following, probability was binned into the following classes: 1) Unlikely, probability ≤0.33; 2) Likely as not, probability >0.33 and ≤0.66; and 3) Likely, probability >0.66. Finally, depth statistics were only recorded when depth was equal to or greater than 0. We calculated the median depth, 25th percentile, 75th percentile, and interquartile range using all the pixels that met this criterion. When utilizing the depth statistics, it is important to also consider the probability of this pixel being flooded. In other words, the depth layers may show some depth returns, but the pixel may have rarely been inundated for the 1,000 iterations."
"Digital elevation model of Mount St. Helens, Washington and vicinity prior to the 1980 eruption - Catalog",https://catalog.data.gov//dataset/digital-elevation-model-of-mount-st-helens-washington-and-vicinity-prior-to-the-1980-erupt,"On May 18, 1980, Mount St. Helens, Washington, exploded in a spectacular and devastating eruption that resulted in previously unimaginable events that drastically altered the mountain and the surrounding area. One unprecedented event was the collapse of the summit and north flank of the volcano forming a huge landslide known as the ‘debris avalanche’ with a total volume of about 2.5 km3 (3.3 billion cubic yards). The debris avalanche swept around and up ridges to the north, but most of it turned westward as far as 23 km (14 mi) down the valley of the North Fork Toutle River and formed a hummocky deposit. This had a profound effect on the topography of the area, including transforming the summit cone of the volcano into an amphitheater-shaped crater, in places, burying the valley north of the volcano under hundreds of feet of debris, and filling the Spirit Lake basin raising the surface elevation 64 m (210 ft). 
This release consists of a 10-meter resolution digital elevation model, covering an area of 196.45 sq km, and hillshade map of the summit and valley north of the volcano circa 1952 surface derived from contour lines digitized from historic topographic maps. These data represent the paleo topography of Mt St. Helens and vicinity that were most significantly altered by the 1980 eruption and debris avalanche."

Post-hurricane marsh restoration efforts have included sediment deposition, planting of vegetation, and restoring tidal hydrology. The work presented here is part of a larger project funded by the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation (NFWF) to monitor the post-restoration ecological resilience of coastal ecosystems in the wake of Hurricane Sandy. The U.S. Geological Survey Woods Hole Coastal and Marine Science Center made in-situ observations during 2018-2019 and 2022-2023 at two sites: Thompsons Beach, NJ and Stone Harbor, NJ. Marsh creek hydrodynamics and water quality including currents, waves, water levels, water temperature, salinity, pH, dissolved oxygen, turbidity, organic matter, chlorophyll-a, and suspended-sediment concentration and organic content were measured at both sites.  Additionally, marsh accretion and erosion were evaluated and used to interpret sediment budgets. These ecological data will be coupled with topographic lidar and imagery to explain the processes responsible for coastline evolution, and to evaluate restoration techniques and assess whether storm vulnerability has decreased relative to unaltered environments."

Four source waters and three sand filtrate samples were collected from the intakes and sand filters of Lake Erie drinking-water plants and transported to the USGS Ohio Water Microbiology Laboratory, where investigators set up microcosms to enrich for and identify indigenous bacteria capable of degrading microcystins. Quality control samples were set up in the microcosms to check analyses and included positive controls, negative controls, and replicates. Microcystin biodegradation was quantified by the disappearance of the toxin as compared to control cultures in microcosm and microplate experiments, and by the presence of a gene within microcystin-degrading bacteria that encodes for an enzyme involved in the initial steps of biodegradation. Bacteria were isolated from microcosms enriched with microcystin-LR (MC-LR) and MC-LR concentrations were measured over time by ELISA (table 1). Isolates were selected from the microcosm experiments for further growth testing in microplate experiments with various enrichment media and MC-LR over 96 hours (table 2). Biofilm formation potential for the isolates were also measured and data is shown in table 3. Isolate absorbances of ten potential microcystin degraders were incubated in a microplate with MC-LR as the sole carbon source (table 4) and concentrations of MC-LR in microplate wells were measured over time (table 5)."

It has a long history of explosive and sometimes devastating eruptions. Beginning in December 2020 and ending in April 2021, La Soufrière Volcano produced a Volcano Explosivity Index (VEI) 4 eruption that greatly impacted the landscape, communities, and infrastructure on the island of St. Vincent. The eruption produced intense ash plumes, heavy ashfall, and pyroclastic flows down several river valleys. During and following the eruption, destructive lahars (volcanic mudflows) impacted rivers valleys and coastal communities for months. The USGS-USAID Volcano Disaster Assistance Program (VDAP) provided remote assistance to our partners at the University of the West Indies Seismic Research Center (UWI-SRC) throughout the eruption, predominantly through satellite remote sensing observations. Following the eruption, VDAP contracted the acquisition of airborne lidar of the entire island to support our partners throughout the Eastern Caribbean to study the eruption’s impacts, assist in recovery and planning efforts, hazards modeling, and various other scientific investigations. This data release contains the results of this survey that include 0.6 m and 1 m resolution bare-earth digital elevation models (DEMs) and associated shaded-relief rasters of the island of St. Vincent.

"Measurement of benthic invertebrates, zooplankton, stamp sands and metals from four beaches near Keweenaw Bay, Lake Superior in 2021 - Catalog",https://catalog.data.gov//dataset/measurement-of-benthic-invertebrates-zooplankton-stamp-sands-and-metals-from-four-beaches-,"Between 1900 and 1932, a copper (Cu) mine operated near Gay, Michigan, along the shore of Lake Superior, discharged approximately 22.8 million metric tons of waste material known as ‘stamp sands’ (SS) to a nearby beach.  This pile of SS has migrated via wind and rain along the beaches in northern Grand Traverse Bay and into Buffalo Reef, an important spawning area for Lake Trout and Lake Whitefish.  During their first summer, these newly spawned fish consume benthic invertebrates and zooplankton in nearby beach habitats.  SS contain elevated concentrations of metals (especially Cu) that are toxic to many invertebrate taxa, and studies have observed very few benthic taxa in areas with very high SS.   Here, we sampled the invertebrate community from four beaches: one near Buffalo Reef with very high SS, one in southern Grand Traverse Bay with moderate SS, one in the nearby Little Traverse Bay with very little SS and a beach ~58 km away with no SS (Big Bay).  We also re-sampled the benthos at some sites that had been sampled as part of an earlier study.  Both benthic invertebrates (in August 2021) and zooplankton (in June and July 2021) were sampled along the transects at these four beaches.  Sediment samples were collected at the same time as the benthic invertebrate sampling and used to quantify SS and 12 metals at each site (including Cu)."

Objective(s) of our study were to investigate whether topographic changes can serve as a proxy for aeolian transport and sediment mobility in dunefield environments. This was accomplished by relating topographic changes to modeled and observed estimates of sediment transport and dune mobility over months to decades within a partially vegetated dunefield starved of upwind sediment supplies. We specifically tested if topographic changes measured as net and total volume changes and topographic surface roughness differences provide evidence for intra-annual differences and decadal changes in sediment mobility for dune sand that is either currently bare, vegetated, or biocrust-covered. Lastly, these data were used as a framework for interpreting how aeolian transport and sediment mobility has changed for current land cover types over the preceding four decades. These data represent monthly topographic surveys and in-field sediment transport data collected between February 13, 2020 and December 16, 2020, piloted aerial imagery collected in 1984, 2002, 2009, 2013, and 2021, unoccupied aerial vehicle (UAV) imagery collected in March 2021, classification of land cover, and tabular summaries of topographic changes derived from these datasets. These data were collected between 1984 and 2021 within a small aeolian dunefield near the confluence of the Paria and Colorado Rivers, upstream of Grand Canyon National Park, Arizona. These data were collected by the U.S. Geological Survey. These data can be used to 1) to evaluate how dune surfaces with bare sand, sand with vegetated cover, and sand with biological soil crust cover (biocrust) change on a monthly time scale with differences in wind strength and 2) assess how the dunefield surface changed with vegetation loss and expansion over almost 4 decades. Additionally, these data could be used to assess detailed changes in landscape cover over monthly and decadal time scales."

The Coastwide Reference Monitoring System (CRMS) was developed to assist in a multiple-reference approach that uses aspects of hydrogeomorphic functional assessments and probabilistic sampling for monitoring. The CRMS program includes a suite of approximately 398 sites that encompass the range of hydrological and ecological conditions for each stratum. As part of CRMS, land and water classifications are created from Digital Orthophoto Quarter Quadrangles (DOQQs) approximately every three years at all CRMS sites. A DOQQ is a raster image in which displacement in the image caused by sensor orientation and terrain relief has been removed and combines the image characteristics of a photo with geometric qualities of a map. The DOQQs generated for this project consist of 2021 Color Infrared (CIR) Digital Imagery. These images were classified into land and water categories using a threshold of the near infrared (NIR) band, followed by supervised and unsupervised classification.  Initial classification results are then reviewed by multiple image analysts to identify and manually recode errors. The final land-water classifications are intended to serve as both geographic and quantitative assessments of landscape composition on the date of acquisition. Five previous assessments have been conducted (2005, 2008, 2012, 2015/2016, and 2018). Once the program creates enough data points for statistical analyses, these data will be used for land area change rate calculation."

A total of 119 images acquired between 2008 and 2022 were analyzed to produce 143 thematic land-cover raster datasets. Water, bare earth (sand), and vegetated land-cover classes were mapped using successive thresholding and masking of the modified normalized difference water index (mNDWI), the normalized difference bare land index (NBLI), and the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and applying a rule-based classification modified from the workflow described by Bernier and others (2021). Vector shoreline and sand feature extents were extracted for each image by contouring the spectral indices using the calculated threshold values. These data support the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation (NFWF)-funded Monitoring Hurricane Sandy Beach and Marsh Resilience in New York and New Jersey project (NFWF project ID 2300.16.055110), for which the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) St. Petersburg Coastal and Marine Science Center (SPCMSC) is using remotely-sensed data and targeted in-situ observations to monitor the post-restoration evolution of beaches, dunes, vegetative cover, and sediment budgets at seven post-Hurricane Sandy beach and marsh restoration sites in New York and New Jersey.

The RCMAP product suite consists of ten fractional components: annual herbaceous, bare ground, herbaceous, litter, non-sagebrush shrub, perennial herbaceous, sagebrush, shrub, tree, and shrub height in addition to the temporal trends of each component. Several enhancements were made to the RCMAP process relative to prior generations. First, high-resolution training was revised using an improved neural-net classifier and modelling approach. These data serve as foundation to the RCMAP approach. The training database was further improved by incorporating additional datasets. Next, the Landsat compositing approach was improved to better capture the range of conditions from across each year and through time. These composites are based on Collection 2 Landsat data with improved geolocation accuracy and dynamic range. Finally, the Canadian portion of the sagebrush biome was included, which expanded the study area by 29,199 km2. 
Processing efficiency has been increased using open-source software and USGS High-Performance Computing (HPC) resources. The mapping area included eight regions which were subsequently mosaicked.

The DOQQs generated for this project consist of 2021 Color Infrared (CIR) Digital Imagery. These images were classified into land and water categories using a threshold of the near infrared (NIR) band, followed by supervised and unsupervised classification.  Initial classification results are then reviewed by multiple image analysts to identify and manually recode errors. The final land-water classifications are intended to serve as both geographic and quantitative assessments of landscape composition on the date of acquisition. Five previous assessments have been conducted (2005, 2008, 2012, 2015/2016, and 2018).

As part of the Cross-Shore and Inlets Processes project to improve our understanding of cross-shore processes that control sediment budgets, the U.S. Geological Survey deployed instrumented platforms at two sites near Matanzas Inlet between January 24 and April 13, 2018. Matanzas Inlet is a natural, unmaintained inlet on the Florida Atlantic coast that is well suited for study of inlet and cross-shore processes. The study sites were offshore of the surf zone in a line perpendicular to the coast in water depth from 9 to 15 meters. An instrumented sea-floor platform was deployed at each site to measure ocean currents, wave motions, acoustic and optical backscatter, temperature, salinity, and pressure with an emphasis on quantifying the forcing for sediment transport and response near the seabed. Sonars mounted on the platform at the shallow site recorded how the sea-floor bedforms responded to forcing conditions. A surface buoy was deployed at each site; the larger buoy at the deeper site supported meteorological measurement of local atmospheric conditions during the study, and both buoys measured near-surface water temperature and salinity. Sediment samples were collected at the study sites to support these oceanographic and water-quality measurements, and grain size was analyzed for use in sediment transport models to compare predicted estimates of sediment resuspension and transport with observed estimates.  Grain-size results are presented in phi and μm units."

"Lidar point cloud data for an aeolian dune field near Lees Ferry, AZ - Catalog",https://catalog.data.gov//dataset/lidar-point-cloud-data-for-an-aeolian-dune-field-near-lees-ferry-az,"These data were compiled for assessing how geomorphic changes measured as topographic differences from repeat surveys represent measured and modelled estimates of aeolian sediment transport and dune mobility. Objective(s) of our study were to investigate whether topographic changes can serve as a proxy for aeolian transport and sediment mobility in dunefield environments. This was accomplished by relating topographic changes to modeled and observed estimates of sediment transport and dune mobility over months to decades within a partially vegetated dunefield starved of upwind sediment supplies. We specifically tested if topographic changes measured as net and total volume changes and topographic surface roughness differences provide evidence for intra-annual differences and decadal changes in sediment mobility for dune sand that is either currently bare, vegetated, or biocrust-covered. Lastly, these data were used as a framework for interpreting how aeolian transport and sediment mobility has changed for current land cover types over the preceding four decades. These data represent monthly topographic surveys and in-field sediment transport data collected between February 13, 2020 and December 16, 2020, piloted aerial imagery collected in 1984, 2002, 2009, 2013, and 2021, unoccupied aerial vehicle (UAV) imagery collected in March 2021, classification of land cover, and tabular summaries of topographic changes derived from these datasets. These data were collected between 1984 and 2021 within a small aeolian dunefield near the confluence of the Paria and Colorado Rivers, upstream of Grand Canyon National Park, Arizona. These data were collected by the U.S. Geological Survey. These data can be used to 1) to evaluate how dune surfaces with bare sand, sand with vegetated cover, and sand with biological soil crust cover (biocrust) change on a monthly time scale with differences in wind strength and 2) assess how the dunefield surface changed with vegetation loss and expansion over almost 4 decades. Additionally, these data could be used to assess detailed changes in landscape cover over monthly and decadal time scales."

Specimens of immature Papilio (eggs, eggshells, larvae, pupae) and exuviae were collected during surveys and taken to the laboratory at American Samoa Community College for analysis, and in the case of living specimens, rearing. Sampling effort was measured in terms of number, area, and dry weight of host plant leaves examined during each survey. These methods allowed the frequency of specimen encounter to be compared in a standardized way according to the amount of host plant foliage examined on each host tree and in each host plant stand."

The scale and magnitude of climatic influences are largely unknown. We used fractional component cover data for rangeland functional groups and weather data from the 1985 to 2023 reference period in conjunction with soils and topography data to develop empirical models describing the spatio-temporal variation in component cover. To investigate the ramifications of future change across the western US, we extended models based on historical relationships over the reference period to model landscape effects based on future weather conditions from two emissions scenarios (Representative Concentration Pathways [RCP] 4.5 and 8.5) and three time periods (2020s, 2050s, and 2080s). We build upon the projections of Rigge 2022 and Rigge et al. 2023, expanding our study area to include the entire Rangeland Condition Monitoring Assessment and Projection (RCMAP) study area (including all the sagebrush biome and Canadian expansion), using updated climate projections (Mahony et al. 2022), and applying a Deep Neural Net (DNN) classifier. In general, both scenarios yielded similar results, but RCP 8.5 tended to be more extreme, with greater change relative to the reference period. This information can be used to inform management to prepare for future vegetation composition and cover through the prioritization of conservation and restoration and shed light on species range shifts."

Lava erupted from 24 fissures on the lower East Rift Zone over four months, with high effusion rates (>100 m3 s-1) often supplying lava into channelized flows (Dietterich and others 2021).  This effusion produced an extensive lava flow field, covering 36 km2 and creating 3.5 km2 of new land along the coast (Zoeller and others 2020).  The eruption was notable for the sustained high effusion rates, which produced complex and prolonged evolution of the lava flow field, dominated by the large channelized flow from fissure 8 that extended 13 km from the vent to the ocean.  The eruption had a severe impact on the community, destroying over 700 structures in the lower Puna district (Meredith and others 2022). 
In this data release, we include thermal maps of the eruption that document the highly dynamic evolution of the lava flow field on the lower East Rift Zone during this 2018 eruption.  The thermal maps were constructed from oblique airborne imagery from a handheld thermal camera, using structure-from-motion software to construct thermal orthomosaics.  The maps were generally made every 1-3 days, thus providing a sequence to illustrate how the flow field changed through the course of the eruption.  These data are meant to better understand the behavior of large channelized lava flows, in order to improve forecasting their hazards in the future. "

The Humboldt River Basin is the only river basin that is contained entirely within the state of Nevada. The effect of groundwater pumping on the Humboldt River is not well understood. Tools are needed to determine stream capture and manage groundwater pumping in the Humboldt River Basin.  Previous work has demonstrated that the river’s surface-water resource is sensitive to groundwater withdrawals, which have steadily increased since the 1950s for agriculture, municipal, and mining uses. A numerical groundwater flow model was developed for the purpose of estimating stream capture from pre-2016 and future pumping as well as for any location of potential future pumping within the lower Humboldt River Basin. The model was calibrated with historical data from 1960 through 2016. The calibrated historic model was used to evaluate historic capture and a transient predictive model was used to evaluate potential capture anywhere within the lower Humboldt River Basin, Nevada. This USGS data release contains all of the input and output files for the simulations described in the associated model documentation report ("

The Navajo Nation Environmental Protection Agency (NNEPA) periodically samples surface water on the Navajo Nation and has found that some elements exceed NNEPA surface water standards (the upper limits of an element for consumption or other use of water). Constituents of concern are substances that could be harmful if present in sufficient quantities, and it is important to monitor the concentrations of these substances in the environment. In the San Juan River, constituents of concern include metals detected in river water, such as arsenic, lead, and aluminum. These metals can come from natural sources or can result from anthropogenic (human) activities and can affect the health of people, plants, and animals.  The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) is working with the NNEPA to identify sources of metals and trace elements entering the San Juan River from tributaries in the reach flowing through the Navajo Nation, and to quantify the contribution from each natural and human-caused source.
Sediments were collected in sediment traps in 33 ephemeral or perennial channels that flow into the San Juan River.  The sediment traps were placed in the apparent thalweg of the channel, and attached to a T-post.  Sites were checked every 2 to 3 weeks and sediment traps were collected if material accumulated.  If the traps were empty, they were left deployed.  The sediment traps filled during storm events.

Topographic profiles were collected by walking along survey lines with global navigation satellite system (GNSS) receivers mounted on backpacks. Prior to data collection, vertical distances between the GNSS antennas and the ground were measured using a tape measure. Hand-held data collectors were used to log raw data and display navigational information allowing surveyors to navigate survey lines spaced at 100- to 1000-m intervals along the beach. Profiles were surveyed from the landward edge of the study area (either the base of a bluff, engineering structure, or just landward of the primary dune) over the beach foreshore, to wading depth on the same series of transects as nearshore bathymetric surveys that were conducted during the same time period. Additional topographic data were collected between survey lines in some areas with an all-terrain vehicle (ATV) equipped with a GNSS receiver to constrain the elevations and alongshore extent of major morphological features. Positioning data from the survey platforms were referenced to a GNSS base station with known horizontal and vertical coordinates relative to the North American Datum of 1983. Differential corrections from the GNSS base stations to the survey platforms were either applied in real-time with a UHF radio link, or post-processed using Trimble Business Center software. Orthometric elevations relative to the NAVD88 vertical datum were computed using National Geodetic Survey Geoid12a offsets. The average estimated vertical uncertainty of the topographic measurements is 4 cm.

These datasets were developed using 1-m digital elevation model (DEM) from 2018 with reduced elevation error in coastal wetlands (McHenry and others, 2023). This data release includes results from analyses of two local sea-level rise scenarios for two-time steps — the Intermediate-Low and Intermediate-High for 2050 and 2100 from Sweet and others (2022). Additionally, this data release includes maps of inundation probability under the minor, moderate, and major high tide flooding thresholds defined by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). We estimated the probability of an area being inundated under a given scenario using Monte Carlo simulations with 1,000 iterations. For an individual iteration, each pixel of the DEM was randomly propagated based on the lidar data uncertainty, while the sea-level rise and high tide flooding water level estimates were also propagated based on uncertainty in the sea-level rise estimate (Sweet and others, 2022) and tidal datum transformation, respectively. Moreover, the probability of a pixel being inundated was calculated by summing the binary simulation outputs and dividing by 1,000. Following, probability was binned into the following classes: 1) Unlikely, probability ≤0.33; 2) Likely as not, probability >0.33 and ≤0.66; and 3) Likely, probability >0.66. Finally, depth statistics were only recorded when depth was equal to or greater than 0. We calculated the median depth, 25th percentile, 75th percentile, and interquartile range using all the pixels that met this criterion. When utilizing the depth statistics, it is important to also consider the probability of this pixel being flooded. In other words, the depth layers may show some depth returns, but the pixel may have rarely been inundated for the 1,000 iterations.

In 2015 U.S. Geological Survey ecologists recorded vegetation and soil moisture data in 36 experimental plots which manipulated precipitation in two plant community types. The experiment consisted of three precipitation treatments: control (ambient precipitation), cool-season drought (-66% ambient precipitation November-April), and warm-season drought (-66% ambient precipitation May-October), applied in two plant communities (perennial grasses with or without a large shrub, Ephedra viridis) over a three-year period. These data were collected from 2015 to 2022 near Canyonlands National Park, UT. These data represent precipitation, soil moisture, percent cover estimates, soil biogeochemistry data (carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus concentrations) and biomass from experimental treatments. The datasets includes data on when treatments were imposed, ambient precipitation, soil moisture measured at two depths, plant cover and plant biomass measured in the spring and fall from 2015-2019. Additionally, soil cores were collected in the fall 2018 and spring 2019 to measure biogeochemical cycling concentrations for available carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus, and microbial biomass. Standing grass biomass and Ephedra viridis biomass are done through allometric relationships based on a combination of point-frame green hits, leaf lengths, and leaf numbers, combined with double sampling.  The biomass data provide an estimate of how treatments are impacting overall grass and shrub species productivity.  These data can be used to compare the effects of drought seasonality on shrub and grass communities and biogeochemistry dynamics."

Standard 1 inch paleomagnetism core samples were collected from 11 coreholes. The samples were characterized for polarity and average paleomagnetic inclinations over the entire length of the drill core. However, paleomagnetic declination data were not obtained due to the original azimuth of the drill cores not being preserved during drilling. The samples were extracted from individual lava flows based on identification of flow tops and bottoms in the drill core. These samples were then transported to the USGS Paleomagnetic Laboratory for sample preparation and analysis.  About 1800 plugs were collected and both positive and negative inclination values were found.

The MAP region supports a multibillion-dollar agricultural industry. The MAP is part of the Mississippi Embayment with several water-bearing units that make up the Mississippi Embayment Regional Aquifer System (MERAS). These water bearing units include the Mississippi River Valley Alluvial aquifer, Claiborne aquifers and Wilcox aquifers. In northeastern Arkansas, the Cache area has been designated as a critical groundwater areas because of decades of groundwater declines that resulted from past and current water use. The objective of the report assocated with this data release is to document and describe the construction, calibration, and results of the inset groundwater-flow model developed for the Cache River Critical Groundwater Area using the latest MODFLOW-6 code. The Cache model derived boundary conditions from the parent MERAS 3 regional model to provide higher resolution simulations in the Cache focus areas. The Cache model was spatially discretized into 500-meter x 500-meter orthogonal cells on a grid. The Cache model had 18 vertical layers, 161 rows, and 142 columns and simulated the Quaternary-age alluvial aquifer with 5-m constant thickness layers and increasing thickness layers for the Tertiary-age units below the alluvial aquifer. The Cache model included 148 stress periods with a simulation period from January 1, 1900 through December 31, 2018 where stress periods: April 1, 2007 through December 31, 2018 where monthly stress periods. Areal recharge was simulated by a soil-water-balance model of the MERAS and passed to the groundwater models. The model simulated agricultural and municipal pumping. The model simulated groundwater-surface water interactions and total streamflow by adding runoff from the soil-water-balance model. The model featured high-dimensional parameterization schemes for calibration using the PEST++ Iterative Ensemble Smoother. Mean absolute residuals for the calibrated priority well observations was 1.58 meters. Mean horizontal hydraulic conductivity for the alluvial aquifer was about 36 meters per day for the Cache model. Calibrated annual areal recharge was 2.2 inches for the Cache model. Primary groundwater outflows represented in the model were from agricultural wells. New avenues for highly parameterized environmental model calibration have become available with computationally efficient ensemble methods. Such methods, however, can be affected by spurious parameter correlation whereby some combinations of parameters may be erroneously adjusted to improve the fit to the observation data when they are spatially and temporally unrelated. Furthermore, ensemble methods can suffer “ensemble collapse” with too many failed runs, limiting the utility of a calibration to find an optimal range of parameter values and uncertainty. A technique called localization can help address both spurious correlation between parameters and ensemble collapse. However, localization is computationally intensive to implement, especially for highly parameterized models. Localization computation time can be substantially longer than hundreds of parallelized ensemble forward runs. Therefore, tradeoffs need to be evaluated that affect the efficiency and perhaps outcome of a modeling analysis, such as between the benefits of limiting spurious parameter correlations, reasonable solution times, efficient use of computing resources, and allowing enough degrees of freedom to adequately explore parameter space. In this study, we compare the results of a MODFLOW6 groundwater-flow model developed for a region with extensive groundwater irrigation in northeastern Arkansas, history matched using 11,746 adjustable parameters and 6,818 observations with and without the auto-adaptive localization feature of the PEST++ iterative ensemble smoother tool PESTPP-IES. Two versions of the same model were run with an initial prior ensemble of 500 realizations and three iterations, whereby 194 runs completed with localization and 192 runs completed without localization. Total calibration runtimes were 15 hours with localization and one hour without localization. Preliminary results indicate that the number of parameters have an impact on the number of completed realizations while the computational burden of localization substantially increased total solution times by an order of magnitude. The average objective function was about 5 percent larger for the runs with localization. Some benefits of localization included better preservation of spatial parameter zones, less parameter deviation from prior values, and less overfitting. Such information is important for developing efficient workflows for ensemble methods, especially when running on pay-as-needed cloud resources."
Long-term monotonic trends in annual groundwater metrics in the United States through 2020 - Catalog,https://catalog.data.gov//dataset/long-term-monotonic-trends-in-annual-groundwater-metrics-in-the-united-states-through-2020,"The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) Water Resources Mission Area (WMA) is working to address a need to understand where the Nation is experiencing water shortages or surpluses relative to the demand by delivering routine assessments of water supply and demand. A key part of these national assessments is identifying long-term trends in water availability, including groundwater and surface water quantity, quality, and use.  This data release contains Mann-Kendall monotonic trend analyses for annual groundwater metrics at 39,964 wells located in the conterminous United States, Alaska, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico. 
The groundwater metrics include annual mean, maximum, and minimum water level and the timing of the annual maximum and minimum groundwater level. These metrics are computed from groundwater water levels from publicly available data from the National Water Information System (NWIS) and the National Groundwater Monitoring Network (NGWMN). Trend analyses are computed using annual groundwater metrics through the water year, which is defined as the 12-month period October 1, for any given year through September 30 of the following year and named for the year in which it ends  (for example, October 2019 through September 2020 is water year 2020). Trends at each well are available for up to three different periods: i) the longest possible period that meets completeness criteria at each well, (ii) 1981-2020, (iii) 2001-2020. 
Annual mean, maximum, and minimum water-level metrics for wells screened in unconfined aquifers were determined only when a well's water-level time series was at least 70 percent complete.  Additionally, each of these time series must have at least 70 percent complete records in the first and last decade.  All longest possible period time series for wells in unconfined aquifer must be at least 10 years long and have annual metric values calculated for at least 70% of the years of the record.  Annual mean, maximum, and minimum water-level metrics for wells screened in confined aquifers were determined only when a well's water-level time series was at least 50 percent complete.  Additionally, each of these time series must have at least 50 percent complete records in the first and last decade.  All longest possible period time series for wells in confined aquifer must be at least 10 years long and have annual metric values calculated for at least 50% of the years in the last 10 years of the record. 
Caution must be exercised when utilizing monotonic trend analyses conducted over periods of up to several decades (and in some places longer ones) due to the potential for confounding deterministic gradual trends with multi-decadal climatic fluctuations.

Bathymetry data were collected using four personal watercraft (PWCs) equipped with single-beam sonar systems and global navigation satellite system (GNSS) receivers. The sonar systems consisted of either an Odom Echotrac CV-100 or CEE Hydrosystems Ceescope single-beam echosounder and 200 kHz transducer with a 9-degree beam angle. Raw acoustic backscatter returns were digitized by the echosounder with a vertical resolution of 1.25 cm. Depths from the echosounders were computed using sound velocity profiles measured using a YSI CastAway CTD during the survey. Positioning of the survey vessels was determined at 5 to 10 Hz using either Trimble R9s or Trimble BD990 GNSS receivers. Output from the GNSS receivers and sonar systems were combined in real time on the PWC by a computer running HYPACK hydrographic survey software. Navigation information was displayed on a video monitor, allowing PWC operators to navigate along survey lines at speeds of 2 to 3 m/s. Survey-grade positions of the PWCs were achieved with a single-base station and differential post-processing. Positioning data from the GNSS receivers were post-processed using Waypoint Grafnav to apply differential corrections from a GNSS base station with known horizontal and vertical coordinates relative to the North American Datum of 1983. Orthometric elevations relative to the NAVD88 vertical datum were computed using National Geodetic Survey Geoid12a offsets. Bathymetric data were merged with post-processed positioning data and spurious soundings were removed using a custom Graphical User Interface (GUI) programmed with the computer program MATLAB. The average estimated vertical uncertainty of the bathymetric measurements is 10 cm. The final point data from the PWCs are provided in a comma-separated text file and are projected in cartesian coordinates using the Washington State Plane South, meters coordinate system."

Hydrographic data were collected using a RESON 210 kHz NaviSound single-beam echosounder (SBES) with a Hemisphere A222 integrated global navigation satellite system (GNSS) smart antenna. The SBES and GNSS antenna were mounted on a marine survey vessel, and data were collected as the survey vessel traversed the lake along planned survey lines. A total of 380 survey lines were oriented approximately perpendicular to the primary flow direction at generally 250-foot or 500-foot spacing. Data collection software (HYPACK) integrated and stored the depth and position data from the SBES and GNSS antenna in real time. Water-surface elevations were measured at the boat ramp at the dam twice a day (before and after surveying) with a Trimble R8 survey-grade integrated GNSS system with real-time kinematic (RTK) observations to convert measured bathymetric depths to elevations referenced to the North American Vertical Datum of 1988 (NAVD 88). RTK observations were made using the Kentucky Continually Operating Reference System (KYCORS) network operated by the Kentucky Transportation Cabinet. Data processing required computer software to extract the bathymetric data from the raw data files and to compile and map the information. The final comma-delimited file contains columns of Easting and Northing in feet North American Datum of 1983 (NAD83) Kentucky State Plane Single Zone (FIPS code 1600), and Elevation in feet NAVD 88.

Measurements of Water Quality Constituents in Groundwater Within 1 Mile (1.61 km) of Orphaned Wells in the United States - Catalog,https://catalog.data.gov//dataset/measurements-of-water-quality-constituents-in-groundwater-within-1-mile-1-61-km-of-orphane,"This is a combined dataset from the USGS Orphaned Well Dataset (Grove and Merrill, 2022) and publicly available data from the USGS National Water Information System (NWIS) obtained via the Water Quality Portal using the USGS Python dataretrieval library. This dataset is composed of water quality measurements from groundwater sites located within 1 mile of the locations of unplugged orphaned wells listed in the United States Documented Unplugged Orphaned Oil and Gas Well Dataset.
This dataset contains measurements of common water quality parameters (pH, temperature, specific conductance, TDS), dissolved light hydrocarbons and their isotopes
(Methane, δ13C in methane, δ2H in methane, ethane, δ13C in ethane, propane, and butane), constituents that can indicate the presence of brines and geologic fluids and be used to assess corrosivity (calcium, chloride, bromide, alkalinity), measurements that can be used to assess the potential for biogenic methane production (sulfate, sulfur isotopes, oxidation/reduction potential), as well as isotopic tracers of hydrologic processes (δ2H and δ18O in water and tritium).
The data include supporting information about the water quality measurement sites that can help provide context to the water quality measurements.
The data is presented in several ways, including all individual measurements, the average water quality near each orphaned well in the dataset, water quality measurements averaged near orphaned well (less than 100 meters), and averaged for distances at further away (100 meters to 1.6 kilometers), as well as the combined subset of data where there are measurements for both the near (less than 100 meters) and far (between 100 meters an 1.6 kilometer) radius.

This data release also contains batch formatted specification (PkFlows_AllSites.psf) and output (PEAKFLOWS_ALLSITES.PRT) files from log-Pearson type III (LPIII) flood-frequency analysis of the annual peak streamflow data in version 7.4 of the USGS PeakFQ software (Flynn and others, 2006), which implements the Bulletin 17C (England and others, 2018) methodology for determining flood flow frequency. A comma separated values file (FloodFrequencyEstimates.csv) with estimates of flood magnitudes for selected annual exceedance probabilities from three different types of flood-frequency analysis (LPIII, regional regression equations, and weighted LPIII) is also included. 
The basins of the selected streamgages include the Sacandaga River basin (located within the upper Hudson River basin), and the East and West Canada Creek basins (located within the Mohawk River basin). Annual peak streamflow data were obtained from the USGS National Water Information System (U.S. Geological Survey, 2016). Considerations that informed the PeakFQ specifications for all six streamgages (including the effect of regulation, differences in station and regional skew, and other considerations) are discussed in Graziano and others (2024). Regional regression equation estimates were obtained for the locations of the four streamgages where streamflow is unregulated (01321000, 01342797, 01343060, and 01348000) using the StreamStats web application (U.S. Geological Survey, 2019), which presently utilizes equations in Lumia and others (2006). Weighted LPIII estimates (for the same four streamgages where streamflow is unregulated) were computed by weighting the (at-site) LPIII estimates with the regional regression equation estimates (Lumia and others (2006), equation 3). The weighted LPIII estimates are considered the most accurate of the three types of flood-frequency estimates. For this analysis, stationarity in the annual peak streamflow records was assumed after visual inspection of the records indicated no clear trends."

One commercially available product (Kordon Ich Attack) was also tested, however was omitted from these data as it was not effective at the highest dosage trialed (100 microliters [µL] of the product in 900 µL ciliate culture). The efficacy of the compounds was tested by applying each to subcultures of Philaster apodigitiformis (strain FWC2) originally isolated from coelomic fluid of Diadema antillarum specimen collected from a reef in Key Largo, Florida (FL) on June 15th, 2022 (Hewson, and others, 2023). The compounds were tested at the U.S. Geological Survey St. Petersburg Coastal and Marine Science Center (USGS SPCMSC), Coral Microbial Ecology Laboratory in St. Petersburg, FL, USA between November 2022 and August 2023. Prior to treatment, the compounds were dissolved in either dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) or sterile deionized water (DI) to create 20 millimolar (mM) stocks, and further diluted in sterile artificial seawater (ASW) to generate 1 mM working stocks. These working stocks were then used to create final testing concentrations of 100 micromolar (µM), 50 µM, 25 µM, 12.5 µM, 6.25 µM, and 3.13 µM for each run of the experiment. Controls included 1000 µL of unamended culture and 900 µL culture plus either: 100 µL ASW, 100 µL DMSO diluted in ASW to the highest concentration used in the drug trials (i.e., 10 µL DMSO in 190 µL ASW), or 100 µL DI water diluted in ASW to the highest concentration used in the drug trials (i.e., 10 µL DI in 190 µL ASW). Compounds identified to be effective within 24 hours were then trialed for 15-minute exposure periods. Each potentially effective compound was tested at its highest dosage (100 µM) by mixing 90 µL of scuticociliate culture and 10 µL of 1 mM stock solution on a Sedgwick Rafter chamber and observing the mixture continuously for 15 minutes using a Meiji Techno EMZ-13 microscope. Each successful treatment was then trialed again for 15 minutes at 50% the previous concentration. During this experiment, only quinacrine and tomatine showed potential for further testing."

The Coastwide Reference Monitoring System (CRMS) was developed to assist in a multiple-reference approach that uses aspects of hydrogeomorphic functional assessments and probabilistic sampling for monitoring. The CRMS program includes a suite of approximately 398 sites that encompass the range of hydrological and ecological conditions for each stratum. As part of CRMS, land and water classifications are created from Digital Orthophoto Quarter Quadrangles (DOQQs) approximately every three years at all CRMS sites. A DOQQ is a raster image in which displacement in the image caused by sensor orientation and terrain relief has been removed and combines the image characteristics of a photo with geometric qualities of a map. The DOQQs generated for this project consist of 2021 Color Infrared (CIR) Digital Imagery. These images were classified into land and water categories using a threshold of the near infrared (NIR) band, followed by supervised and unsupervised classification.  Initial classification results are then reviewed by multiple image analysts to identify and manually recode errors. The final land-water classifications are intended to serve as both geographic and quantitative assessments of landscape composition on the date of acquisition. Five previous assessments have been conducted (2005, 2008, 2012, 2015/2016, and 2018).

ECCOE 2022 Surface Reflectance Validation Dataset - Catalog,https://catalog.data.gov//dataset/eccoe-2022-surface-reflectance-validation-dataset,"Scientists and engineers from the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) Earth Resources Observation and Science Center (EROS) Cal/Val Center of Excellence (ECCOE) collected in situ measurements using field spectrometers to support the validation of surface reflectance products derived from Earth observing remote sensing imagery. Data provided in this data release were collected during select Earth observing satellite overpasses and tests during the months of May through October 2022.
Data was collected at three field sites:  the ground viewing radiometer (GVR) site on the USGS EROS facility in Minnehaha County, South Dakota, a private land holding near the City of Arlington in Brookings County, South Dakota, and a private land holding in Sanborn County, South Dakota.
Each field collection file includes the calculated surface reflectance of each wavelength collected using a dual field spectrometer methodology.  The dual field spectrometer methodology allows for the calculated surface reflectance of each wavelength to be computed using one or both of the spectrometers.  The use of the dual field spectrometers system reduces uncertainty in the field measurements by accounting for changes in solar irradiance.    Both single and dual spectrometer calculated surface reflectance are included with this dataset.  The differing methodologies of the calculated surface reflectance data are denoted as ""Single Spectrometer"" and ""Dual Spectrometer"".  Field spectrometer data are provided as Comma Separated Values (CSV) files and GeoPackage files.  The 09 May 2022 and the 16 June 2022 collection data are calculated using single spectrometer only, due to a technical issue with a field spectrometer."

Transmitted and induced very-low-frequency (VLF) magnetic fields were measured with a handheld VLF receiver along transects spanning the dike trace, and zones of ground cracking related to the intrusion were mapped. This dataset records the density and vesicularity of selected lava and tephra samples collected from the June 2007 Father's Day eruption site. The density of the basalt erupted was determined by measuring the weight of spatter and lava clasts in air and water following the approach of Houghton and Wilson (1989). Density was converted to vesicularity using a dense rock equivalent density of 2.75 g/cm3 (Lesher and Spera, 2015)."
"Compilation of topographic data, aerial imagery, and land cover classification, collected between 1984 to 2021 for an aeolian dune field near Lees Ferry, AZ - Catalog",https://catalog.data.gov//dataset/compilation-of-topographic-data-aerial-imagery-and-land-cover-classification-collected-bet,"These data were compiled for assessing how geomorphic changes measured as topographic differences from repeat surveys represent measured and modelled estimates of aeolian sediment transport and dune mobility. Objective(s) of our study were to investigate whether topographic changes can serve as a proxy for aeolian transport and sediment mobility in dunefield environments. This was accomplished by relating topographic changes to modeled and observed estimates of sediment transport and dune mobility over months to decades within a partially vegetated dunefield starved of upwind sediment supplies. We specifically tested if topographic changes measured as net and total volume changes and topographic surface roughness differences provide evidence for intra-annual differences and decadal changes in sediment mobility for dune sand that is either currently bare, vegetated, or biocrust-covered. Lastly, these data were used as a framework for interpreting how aeolian transport and sediment mobility has changed for current land cover types over the preceding four decades. These data represent monthly topographic surveys and in-field sediment transport data collected between February 13, 2020 and December 16, 2020, piloted aerial imagery collected in 1984, 2002, 2009, 2013, and 2021, unoccupied aerial vehicle (UAV) imagery collected in March 2021, classification of land cover, and tabular summaries of topographic changes derived from these datasets. These data were collected between 1984 and 2021 within a small aeolian dunefield near the confluence of the Paria and Colorado Rivers, upstream of Grand Canyon National Park, Arizona. These data were collected by the U.S. Geological Survey. These data can be used to 1) to evaluate how dune surfaces with bare sand, sand with vegetated cover, and sand with biological soil crust cover (biocrust) change on a monthly time scale with differences in wind strength and 2) assess how the dunefield surface changed with vegetation loss and expansion over almost 4 decades. Additionally, these data could be used to assess detailed changes in landscape cover over monthly and decadal time scales."

The Coastwide Reference Monitoring System (CRMS) was developed to assist in a multiple-reference approach that uses aspects of hydrogeomorphic functional assessments and probabilistic sampling for monitoring. The CRMS program includes a suite of approximately 398 sites that encompass the range of hydrological and ecological conditions for each stratum. As part of CRMS, land and water classifications are created from Digital Orthophoto Quarter Quadrangles (DOQQs) approximately every three years at all CRMS sites. A DOQQ is a raster image in which displacement in the image caused by sensor orientation and terrain relief has been removed and combines the image characteristics of a photo with geometric qualities of a map. The DOQQs generated for this project consist of 2021 Color Infrared (CIR) Digital Imagery. These images were classified into land and water categories using a threshold of the near infrared (NIR) band, followed by supervised and unsupervised classification.  Initial classification results are then reviewed by multiple image analysts to identify and manually recode errors. The final land-water classifications are intended to serve as both geographic and quantitative assessments of landscape composition on the date of acquisition. Five previous assessments have been conducted (2005, 2008, 2012, 2015/2016, and 2018). Once the program creates enough data points for statistical analyses, these data will be used for land area change rate calculation."

Topographic profiles were collected by walking along survey lines with global navigation satellite system (GNSS) receivers mounted on backpacks. Prior to data collection, vertical distances between the GNSS antennas and the ground were measured using a tape measure. Hand-held data collectors were used to log raw data and display navigational information allowing surveyors to navigate survey lines spaced at 100- to 1000-m intervals along the beach. Profiles were surveyed from the landward edge of the study area (either the base of a bluff, engineering structure, or just landward of the primary dune) over the beach foreshore, to wading depth on the same series of transects as nearshore bathymetric surveys that were conducted during the same time period. Additional topographic data were collected between survey lines in some areas with an all-terrain vehicle (ATV) equipped with a GNSS receiver to constrain the elevations and alongshore extent of major morphological features. Positioning data from the survey platforms were referenced to a GNSS base station with known horizontal and vertical coordinates relative to the North American Datum of 1983. Differential corrections from the GNSS base stations to the survey platforms were either applied in real-time with a UHF radio link, or post-processed using Trimble Business Center software. Orthometric elevations relative to the NAVD88 vertical datum were computed using National Geodetic Survey Geoid12a offsets. The average estimated vertical uncertainty of the topographic measurements is 4 cm. The final point data are provided in comma-separated text format and are projected in Cartesian coordinates using the Washington State Plane South, meters coordinate system."

The interpretive datasets and source information presented here are for quadrangle 5, which is one of 18 similarly sized segments of the 3,700 square kilometer (km2) SBNMS region. The seabed of the SBNMS region is a glaciated terrain that is topographically and texturally diverse. Quadrangle 5 includes the shallow, rippled, coarse-grained sandy crest and upper eastern and western flanks of southern Stellwagen Bank, its fine-grained sandy lower western flank, and the muddy seabed in Stellwagen Basin. Water depths range from <25 m on the bank crest to ~100 m in the basin. The data presented here for quadrangle 5 are the foundation for Scientific Investigations Map 3515 (Valentine and Cross, 2024), which presents maps of seabed topography, ruggedness, backscatter intensity, distribution of geologic substrates, sediment mobility, distribution of fine- and coarse-grained sand, and substrate mud content. The maps of quadrangle 5 show the distribution of substrates across the southern part of Stellwagen Bank and the adjacent basins. Bathymetric and seabed backscatter imagery, photographs, video, and grain-size analyses were used to create the geologic interpretations presented here and have been reprocessed and released in segments to supports these interpretations. For the quadrangle 5 interpretations, data from 729 stations were analyzed, including 620 sediment samples. The seabed geology map of quadrangle 5 shows the distribution of 20 substrate types ranging from boulder ridges to mobile and rippled sand, to mud.

Lava erupted from 24 fissures on the lower East Rift Zone over four months, with high effusion rates (>100 m3 s-1) often supplying lava into channelized flows (Dietterich and others 2021).  This effusion produced an extensive lava flow field, covering 36 km2 and creating 3.5 km2 of new land along the coast (Zoeller and others 2020).  The eruption was notable for the sustained high effusion rates, which produced complex and prolonged evolution of the lava flow field, dominated by the large channelized flow from fissure 8 that extended 13 km from the vent to the ocean.  The eruption had a severe impact on the community, destroying over 700 structures in the lower Puna district (Meredith and others 2022). 
In this data release, we include thermal maps of the eruption that document the highly dynamic evolution of the lava flow field on the lower East Rift Zone during this 2018 eruption.  The thermal maps were constructed from oblique airborne imagery from a handheld thermal camera, using structure-from-motion software to construct thermal orthomosaics.  The maps were generally made every 1-3 days, thus providing a sequence to illustrate how the flow field changed through the course of the eruption.  These data are meant to better understand the behavior of large channelized lava flows, in order to improve forecasting their hazards in the future. "

The RCMAP product suite consists of ten fractional components: annual herbaceous, bare ground, herbaceous, litter, non-sagebrush shrub, perennial herbaceous, sagebrush, shrub, tree, and shrub height in addition to the temporal trends of each component. Several enhancements were made to the RCMAP process relative to prior generations. First, high-resolution training was revised using an improved neural-net classifier and modelling approach. These data serve as foundation to the RCMAP approach. The training database was further improved by incorporating additional datasets. Next, the Landsat compositing approach was improved to better capture the range of conditions from across each year and through time. These composites are based on Collection 2 Landsat data with improved geolocation accuracy and dynamic range. Finally, the Canadian portion of the sagebrush biome was included, which expanded the study area by 29,199 km2. 
Processing efficiency has been increased using open-source software and USGS High-Performance Computing (HPC) resources. The mapping area included eight regions which were subsequently mosaicked. These data can be used to answer critical questions regarding the influence of climate change and the suitability of management practices. Component products can be downloaded "

These folds are named, well-known, and have been described as part of several previous tectonic syntheses of the Colorado Plateau (Kelley, 1955; Davis, 1978; 1999). However, no digital data have ever been created that locate these folds in digital map space. This digital dataset compiles mapped locations of monoclinal folds from several geologic maps from the Colorado Plateau, most released only in “paper”, non-vector format. Fold names and their general map trace were guided by regional-scale maps that synthesize the tectonic elements of the Colorado Plateau, but specific location of the fold axes relied on detailed geologic maps, augmented by inspection of imagery and digital elevation models. Structural Uplifts on the Colorado Plateau are doubly plunging, asymmetric, elliptical shaped anticlinal features often bounded on one side by a monoclinal fold. Locations and shapes of the major structural uplifts on the Colorado Plateau were modified from regional tectonic maps (Kelley, 1955; Davis, 1978; 1999) and are included with the digital dataset primarily for reference and context.
The dataset includes a geographic information system geodatabase that contains a polyline feature class of the monocline fold axes and a polygon feature class showing the general location of structural uplifts. Vector data are attributed according to the USGS National Cooperative Geologic Mapping Program’s GeMS digital geologic map schema; monoclines are attributed within a GeologicLines feature class and uplifts are attributed within an OverlayPolys feature class. The spatial data are accompanied by non-spatial tables that describe the sources of geologic information, a glossary of terms, and a Data Dictionary that duplicates the Entity and Attribute information contained in the metadata file. To maximize usability, spatial data are also distributed as shapefiles and tabular data are distributed as ascii text files in comma separated values (CSV) format."

The pre-fire and post-fire subsets included were used to create Normalized Burn Ratio (NBR) and then a differenced Normalized Burn Ratio (dNBR) image. The objective of this assessment was to generate burned area boundaries for each fire. Data bundles also include post-fire subset, pre-fire subset, NBR, and dNBR images. This map layer is a thematic raster image of burn severity classes for all inventoried fires occurring in CONUS during calendar year 2008. Fires omitted from this mapped inventory are those where suitable satellite imagery was not available, or fires which were not discernable from available imagery."

Bathymetry data were collected using four personal watercraft (PWCs) equipped with single-beam sonar systems and global navigation satellite system (GNSS) receivers. The sonar systems consisted of either an Odom Echotrac CV-100 or CEE Hydrosystems Ceescope single-beam echosounder and 200 kHz transducer with a 9-degree beam angle. Raw acoustic backscatter returns were digitized by the echosounder with a vertical resolution of 1.25 cm. Depths from the echosounders were computed using sound velocity profiles measured using a YSI CastAway CTD during the survey. Positioning of the survey vessels was determined at 5 to 10 Hz using either Trimble R9s or Trimble BD990 GNSS receivers. Output from the GNSS receivers and sonar systems were combined in real time on the PWC by a computer running HYPACK hydrographic survey software. Navigation information was displayed on a video monitor, allowing PWC operators to navigate along survey lines at speeds of 2 to 3 m/s. Survey-grade positions of the PWCs were achieved with a single-base station and differential post-processing. Positioning data from the GNSS receivers were post-processed using Waypoint Grafnav to apply differential corrections from a GNSS base station with known horizontal and vertical coordinates relative to the North American Datum of 1983. Orthometric elevations relative to the NAVD88 vertical datum were computed using National Geodetic Survey Geoid12a offsets. Bathymetric data were merged with post-processed positioning data and spurious soundings were removed using a custom Graphical User Interface (GUI) programmed with the computer program MATLAB. The average estimated vertical uncertainty of the bathymetric measurements is 10 cm. The final point data from the PWCs are provided in a comma-separated text file and are projected in cartesian coordinates using the Washington State Plane South, meters coordinate system."
Sediment grain size at river outlets along the California coast - Catalog,https://catalog.data.gov//dataset/sediment-grain-size-at-river-outlets-along-the-california-coast,"Fluvial sediment samples were collected from the lowermost reaches of 21 coastal watersheds in California, in order to characterize surficial grain size of river sediment from deposits that appeared to be recent based on field context. Samples were collected using a trowel to sample the uppermost 10 cm of sediment. Sampled locations included river-deposited sediment, upstream of tidal influence. Samples excluded coarse gravel and cobble grain sizes, if present. The watersheds selected for sampling have relatively little urban land use and no other recent data available on their fluvial sediment grain size. Sediment samples were analyzed for grain size at the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) laboratory in Santa Cruz, California.

For information on the digital elevation model (DEM) source used to develop these datasets refer to the corresponding spatial metadata file (Danielson and others, 2023). This data release includes results from analyses of two local sea-level rise scenarios for two-time steps — the Intermediate-Low and Intermediate-High for 2050 and 2100 from Sweet and others (2022). Additionally, this data release includes maps of inundation probability under the minor, moderate, and major high tide flooding thresholds defined by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). We estimated the probability of an area being inundated under a given scenario using Monte Carlo simulations with 1,000 iterations. For an individual iteration, each pixel of the DEM was randomly propagated based on the lidar data uncertainty, while the sea-level rise and high tide flooding water level estimates were also propagated based on uncertainty in the sea-level rise estimate (Sweet and others, 2022) and tidal datum transformation, respectively. Moreover, the probability of a pixel being inundated was calculated by summing the binary simulation outputs and dividing by 1,000. Following, probability was binned into the following classes: 1) Unlikely, probability ≤0.33; 2) Likely as not, probability >0.33 and ≤0.66; and 3) Likely, probability >0.66. Finally, depth statistics were only recorded when depth was equal to or greater than 0. We calculated the median depth, 25th percentile, 75th percentile, and interquartile range using all the pixels that met this criterion. When utilizing the depth statistics, it is important to also consider the probability of this pixel being flooded. In other words, the depth layers may show some depth returns, but the pixel may have rarely been inundated for the 1,000 iterations."

The eruption, whose vent area was focused at and around Puʻuʻōʻō cone, produced episodic fountaining in its initial few years followed by decades of effusive activity that created an expansive lava flow field (Heliker and Mattox 2003; Orr and others 2015). While vents erupted on the flank of the cone, the activity within the cone’s crater often consisted of lava lakes, lava flows, and small spattering hornitos (Heliker and Mattox 2003; Heliker and others 2003). The crater also experienced several cycles of gradual crater filling culminating in abrupt crater draining, via vents on the cone flanks (Orr and others 2015; Patrick and others 2019).  Activity within Puʻuʻōʻō abruptly ended on April 30, 2018, when magma migrated into the lower East Rift Zone, triggering the destructive eruption in Leilani Estates and nearby regions (Neal and others 2019; Patrick and others 2020)."

The fire was the deadliest and most destructive in California history, destroying more than 18,000 structures and causing at least 85 fatalities. The U.S. Geological Survey sampled surface water in areas affected by the Camp Fire, plus an unburned control site, during two post-fire sampling events, January 21-23, 2019 and February 28 - March 1, 2019. During each of those two sampling events, surface-water samples were collected at 8 stream locations. These 16 water samples were filtered using filters with multiple pore sizes (1.2 µm, 0.8 µm, 0.45 µm, and 0.22 µm) to evaluate colloid transport of trace elements. The filtrates were analyzed for 50 major and trace elements by Inductively Coupled Plasma methods. The 0.45 µm filtrates from the January 2019 sampling event were analyzed for 87Sr/86Sr. Field measurements are reported of water temperature, pH, dissolved oxygen, and turbidity. Data are also reported for the concentration of suspended sediment and the percent of suspended sediment less than 0.0625 mm in diameter in each water sample. During January 21-23, 2019 the USGS team collected streambed sediment at the same 8 locations where water samples were collected. Eleven other samples of fire-affected soils or streambed sediments were collected by USGS during December 2018, January 2019, and March 2019; these sites included soils in close proximity to burned vehicles and structures. Collaborators at California State University, Chico collected water samples at selected stream sites between November 30, 2018 and January 17, 2019 and provided unfiltered split samples to USGS. The USGS recovered suspended particulate solids from these water samples; sufficient particulate material for chemical analysis was recovered from eight of these water samples. The streambed sediments, suspended sediments, and soils were analyzed for 51 major and trace elements by Inductively Coupled Plasma methods and for 87Sr/86Sr."

The survey includes all Bubbly Creek from the confluence with the CS&SC in the north to the Racine Avenue Pump station in the south; various sidings and turning basins along the CS&SC between Kedzie Avenue and South Halsted Street; and the Marine Safety Station harbor near the Chicago Harbor Lock on Lake Michigan. This survey is a continuation and enhancement of the bathymetric survey of the CS&SC in Cook County, Illinois, conducted August 22–24, 2022 (Huizinga and Rivers, 2023). Hydrographic data were collected using a high-resolution multibeam echosounder mapping system (MBMS), which consists of a multibeam echosounder (MBES) and an inertial navigation system (INS) mounted on a marine survey vessel.  Data were collected as the vessel traversed the river along overlapping longitudinal survey lines distributed throughout the reach.  Data collection software integrated and stored the depth data from the MBES and the horizontal and vertical position and attitude data of the vessel from the INS in real time.  Data processing required specialized computer software to extract bathymetry data from the raw data files and to summarize and map the information.
The full-resolution data are provided in American Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing (ASPRS) compressed LAS format as BubblyCr_CSSCsidings_bathymetry_2023-07_fullres.laz.  This bathymetry dataset is the full-resolution, near-raw data output from the processing software.  This dataset has undergone limited cleanup and editing to remove obvious stray data and aquatic vegetation, but data editing was minimized to retain detail.  Furthermore, this dataset is large, and may not be readily viewable without specialized software.
The reduced-resolution data also are provided in ASPRS compressed LAS format as BubblyCr_CSSCsidings_bathymetry_2023-07.laz.

Backscatter data were collected by Fugro Pelagos in 2007 using a combination of 400-kHz Reson 7125, 240-kHz Reson 8101, and 100-kHz Reson 8111 multibeam echosounder systems. The data were post-processed by the California State University Monterey Bay Seafloor Mapping. The acoustic backscatter data are available as a georeferenced TIFF image. Within the final imagery, brighter tones indicate higher backscatter intensity, and darker tones indicate lower backscatter intensity. The intensity represents a complex interaction between the acoustic pulse and the seafloor, as well as characteristics within the shallow subsurface, providing a general indication of seafloor texture and composition. Backscatter intensity depends on the acoustic source level; the frequency used to image the seafloor; the grazing angle; the composition and character of the seafloor, including grain size, water content, bulk density, and seafloor roughness; and some biological cover. Harder and rougher bottom types such as rocky outcrops or coarse sediment typically return stronger intensities (high backscatter, lighter tones), whereas softer bottom types such as fine sediment return weaker intensities (low backscatter, darker tones)."

This method used a combination of discrete groundwater levels from the U.S. Geological Survey National Water Information System, continuous groundwater levels from the National Groundwater Monitoring Network, the State of Wisconsin well-construction database, and NHDPlus version 2.1-derived points. The predicted water table depth utilized the HBRT model available through Scikit-learn in Python version 3.10.10. The HBRT model can predict the surficial water table depth for any latitude and longitude for Wisconsin. A total of 48 predictor variables were used for model development, including basic well characteristics, soil properties, aquifer properties, hydrologic position on the landscape, recharge and evapotranspiration rates, and bedrock characteristics. Model results indicate that the mean surficial water table depth across Wisconsin is 28.3 feet below land surface, with a root mean square error of 7.40 feet for the holdout data to the HBRT model. Aside from the overall HBRT methods contained as part of the Python script, this data release includes a self-contained model directory for recreating the HBRT model published in this data release.

The LTDR project is unique in that it serves as a bridge that connects data derived from the NOAA Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR), the EOS Moderate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), the Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (SNPP) Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS), and Joint Polar Satellite System (JPSS) VIIRS missions.  The LTDR draws from the following eight AVHRR missions: 
NOAA-7, NOAA-9, NOAA-11, NOAA-14, NOAA-16, NOAA-18, NOAA-19, and MetOp-B.
Currently, the project generates a daily surface reflectance product as the fundamental climate data record (FCDR) and derives daily Normalized Differential Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Leaf-Area Index/fraction of absorbed Photosynthetically Active Radiation (LAI/fPAR) as two thematic CDRs (TCDR).  LAI/fPAR was developed as an experimental product.

Sounder SIPS: JPSS-1 CrIS Level 3 Specific Quality Control Gridded Daily CLIMCAPS V2 (SNDRJ1IML3SDCCP) at GES DISC - Catalog,https://catalog.data.gov//dataset/sounder-sips-jpss-1-cris-level-3-specific-quality-control-gridded-daily-climcaps-v2-at-ges-a71d0,"WARNING: To users of the derived product “co_mmr_midtrop” (carbon monoxide mass mixing ratio to dry air [kg/kg] at ~500 hPa). This variable has a significant bias due to a conversion error: the molecular weight of carbon dioxide (CO2, 44.01 g/mol) was used instead of carbon monoxide (CO, 28.01 g/mol). To correct, simply multiply “co_mmr_midtrop” by 28.01/44.01. Alternatively, derive a profile of mass mixing ratio from scratch using the retrieved column density values (“mol_lay/co_mol_lay”) in the Level 2 files. For further questions or concerns please contact the Sounder SIPS at: sounder.sips@jpl.nasa.gov"
SAGE III/ISS L2 Monthly Aerosol Product (NetCDF) V001 - Catalog,https://catalog.data.gov//dataset/sage-iii-iss-l2-monthly-aerosol-product-netcdf-v001,"g3baer_1 is the Stratospheric Aerosol and Gas Experiment III (SAGE III) on the International Space Station (ISS) (SAGE III/ISS) Level 2 Monthly Aerosol Product (NetCDF) V001 data product. It contains all of the aerosol data and flags for a month of solar events. SAGE III was Launched on February 19, 2017 on a SpaceX Falcon 9 from Kennedy Space Center, SAGE III-ISS is the second instrument from the SAGE III project, externally mounted on the ISS. This ISS-based instrument uses a technique known as occultation, which involves looking at the light from the Sun or Moon as it passes through Earth's atmosphere at the edge, or limb, of the planet to provide long-term monitoring of ozone vertical profiles of the stratosphere and mesosphere. The data provided by SAGE III-ISS includes key components of atmospheric composition and their long-term variability, focusing on the study of aerosols, chlorine dioxide, clouds, nitrogen dioxide, nitrogen trioxide, pressure and temperature, and water vapor. SAGE data has historically been used by the World Meteorological Organization to inform their periodic assessments of ozone depletion. These new observations from the International Space Station will continue the SAGE team's contributions to ongoing scientific understanding of the Earth's atmosphere."

METOP-B AVHRR Atmospherically Corrected Normalized Difference Vegetation Index Daily L3 Global 0.05 Deg. CMG - Catalog,https://catalog.data.gov//dataset/metop-b-avhrr-atmospherically-corrected-normalized-difference-vegetation-index-daily-l3-gl,"The Long-Term Data Record (LTDR) produces, validates, and distributes a global land surface climate data record (CDR) that uses both mature and well-tested algorithms in concert with the best-available polar-orbiting satellite data from past to the present.   The CDR is critically important to studying global climate change.  The LTDR project is unique in that it serves as a bridge that connects data derived from the NOAA Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR), the EOS Moderate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), the Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (SNPP) Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS), and Joint Polar Satellite System (JPSS) VIIRS missions.  The LTDR draws from the following eight AVHRR missions: 
NOAA-7, NOAA-9, NOAA-11, NOAA-14, NOAA-16, NOAA-18, NOAA-19, and MetOp-B.
Currently, the project generates a daily surface reflectance product as the fundamental climate data record (FCDR) and derives daily Normalized Differential Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Leaf-Area Index/fraction of absorbed Photosynthetically Active Radiation (LAI/fPAR) as two thematic CDRs (TCDR).  LAI/fPAR was developed as an experimental product."
